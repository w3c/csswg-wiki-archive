## Housing

We have negociated hotel rooms at reduced price at Hotel Gallery, 150 meters away from the meeting venue.The Hotel Gallery is the only luxury business hotel in Seongnam-City, Seoul’s largest commuting satellite city. It is located in the central downtown of Bundang-gu which is the most thriving area of Seongnam City. The area can be connected in 30 minutes from big cities around Seoul, such as Suwon and Anyang.

**We recommend you book your hotel room as soon as possible because we won't be able to keep these rooms for very long.**

## Transport to/from Airport

Traveling options to/from [Sea-Tac Airport](http://www.portseattle.org/sea-tac/Pages/default.aspx) include:

- The [Link Light Rail](http://www.soundtransit.org/Schedules/Central-Link-light-rail?tab=Map) departs every 7.5 to 15 minutes depending on the time of day. The trip takes about 40mn end to end; the fare is \$2.75 one way. This will get you to the Convention Center station, which is 3 miles south of the Adobe office. From the last station (Westlake), it's about a 2km walk to the Courtyard Marriot.
- Taxi fares from the airport to downtown run around \$50 + tip on average.
- Uber users pay \$50 flat for a black car.

## Travel to/from Adobe

- At 3.8 miles the waterfront Marriott is the furthest from the office.
- A number of buses - 26, 28, 40 - can be taken from 3rd & Virginia downtown to Fremont. Ride time ~20-30mn depending on traffic. One-way ride fare is \$2.50.
- Uber/UberX, Lyft and car2go are also available in Seattle.
- This being Seattle, [bike rentals](http://www.ibike.org/ibike/salish/bicycle-rental.htm) are available.
- **Bus travel from Courtyard Marriott**
  - The 40 and 62 buses travel stop within a block from our office, leaving on Westlake Ave. across from the hotel.
  - Both buses will stop right before the Fremont bridge (“Westlake Aly” stop).
  - Only the 40 crosses the bridge and stops at N 34th St.
  - If you get off before the bridge - or right after - the quickest way to Adobe is to start walking across the bridge then down the staircase to the canal bank. These staircases are located right after the blue towers on each side of the bridge. Watch for bike traffic both on the bridge and on the trail at the bottom of the stairs.
  - Fare: \$2.50 at peak time, exact change upon boarding.

## Group dinner

\* This will be held at [hunger](http://hungerseattle.com/) a couple of blocks from our office on the evening of Tuesday 1/28/2014.
