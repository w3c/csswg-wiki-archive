====== CSS Working Group Wiki =======

The CSS Working Group is the [[http://www.w3.org/|W3C]] working group chartered to develop [[http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/|Cascading Style Sheets]] (CSS). We are responsible both for the CSS specifications and for their [[http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/|conformance test suites]]. Our [[http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/current-work|roadmap]] is maintained on the W3C website.

This wiki is to help the CSSWG record [[ideas|resolutions]] and open [[spec|issues]], to share them with public, and to encourage public involvement in the development of CSS and its [[test|test suites]]. Contributions to this wiki are governed by the same conditions as the [[http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/2006/07-incoming-wiki-copyright.html|W3C Mobile Web Wiki Contribution Policy]]. Note that editing is restricted to CSS Working Group members except in the Testing section (which is open to all).

The CSS Working Group welcomes your feedback on our work! Public discussion of our specs happens on the archived [[http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/|www-style]] mailing list, while discussion of our test suites happens on [[http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-css-testsuite/|public-css-testsuite]]. If you are part of a W3C Member organization, you can also access our [[http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-css-wg/|internal mailing list]]. Minutes of our meetings and publishing updates are posted to the [[http://www.w3.org/blog/CSS/|CSS WG Blog]]. See list of [[communications|communications]] channels.

The working group uses the [[planning|planning]] page to coordinate topics for our face-to-face meetings.

See [[http://wiki.csswg.org/?do=recent|recent changes]] for currently active topics.
