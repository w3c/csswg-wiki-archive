### Specification issues tracking script

WORK IN PROGRESS. NOT READY FOR REVIEW.

This page is for editors of CSS modules who want to integrate with the working group's Bugzilla system to track the issues in the specification.

The scripts described here offer the following features:

1.  check that the issues text matches the one in the specification.
2.  check which issues listed in the specification are stale and should be removed.
3.  check which issues in Bugzilla are new and should be listed in the specification.
4.  provides snippets of the code to cut and paste when a new issue is added.

#### How to use the issues tracking script

To enable the tracking script, add the following to your document:

    <script>...</script>
