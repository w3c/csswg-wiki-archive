====== W3C CSS Testing IRC Discussion ======

IRC stands for "Internet Relay Chat". It's a chat protocol used extensively at W3C.

We have weekly "Test Days" on Wednesdays when a bunch of us plan to hang out on the IRC channel to answer questions and discuss CSS testing. There's no set time, but you're more likely to run into people during West Coast daytime / Europe evenings.

===== Server Info =====

We have a channel dedicated to CSS testing. Here's the information you'll need:

  ; Server : irc.w3.org
  ; Port : 6665 (or 80 if 6665 is blocked on your end)
  ; Channel : #css-test

===== IRC Clients =====

You'll need an IRC client. Opera has one built-in. Mozilla has "Chatzilla", which is part of Seamonkey and available as an add-on for Firefox. Pidgin and Trillian can also do IRC. There's a web interface to IRC called [[http://www.mibbit.com/|Mibbit]] (type 'irc.w3.org:6665' as the server name). And there are various stand-alone programs you can download.

===== IRC Commands =====

IRC commands are prefixed with a slash. (Any other text you type into a channel gets posted as a message to the channel.) Some basic commands:

  ; /nick gabriele : change your IRC nick to gabriele
  ; /join #css-test : join the #css-test channel
  ; /query fantasai : start a private chat with fantasai
  ; /me waves hi : speak in the third person
  ; /away sleep : set your away message to "sleep"
  ; /away : remove your away message
  ; /whois fantasai : see information about user fantasai including idle time and away msg (if any)
