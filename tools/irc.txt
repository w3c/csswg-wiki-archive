====== W3C CSS Testing IRC Discussion ======

IRC stands for "Internet Relay Chat". It's a chat protocol used extensively at W3C.

===== Server Info =====

We have a channel dedicated to CSS testing. Here's the information you'll need:

  ; Server : irc.w3.org
  ; Port : 6665 (or 80 if 6665 is blocked on your end)
  ; Channel : #css-test

===== IRC Clients =====

You'll need an IRC client. Opera has one built-in. Mozilla has "Chatzilla", which is part of Seamonkey and available as an add-on for Firefox. Pidgin and Trillian can also do IRC. There's a web interface to IRC called [[http://www.mibbit.com/|Mibbit]] (type 'irc.w3.org:6665' as the server name). And there are various stand-alone programs you can download.

===== IRC Commands =====

IRC commands are prefixed with a slash. (Any other text you type into a channel gets posted as a message to the channel.) Some basic commands:

  ; /nick gabriele : change your IRC nick to gabriele
  ; /join #css-test : join the #css-test channel
  ; /query fantasai : start a private chat with fantasai
  ; /me is sleepy : speak in the third person about yourself being sleepy
  ; /away sleep : set your away message to "sleep"
  ; /away : remove your away message
  ; /whois fantasai : see information about user fantasai including idle time and away msg (if any)
