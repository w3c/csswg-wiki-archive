====== CSS WG Frequently Asked Questions ======

===== www-style =====
The www-style mailing list is the primary forum for discussing the development of CSS, here are some guidelines and answers to frequently asked questions.

==== start subjects with bracketed topics/specs ====
When writing an email to www-style, please start the subject with the particular, topic, specification, property in brackets, e.g.
  * [CSS3-UI][text-overflow] what happens to overflow when you scroll
  * [CSS4] what's planned for CSS4?


==== change the subject when a starting discussion ====
A lot of emails get posted to www-style (such as minutes) which can spark new / specific discussions.

When replying any such email and following-up on a specific aspect or subject, please start a *new* subject with the particular topic in brackets.

E.g. bad:
  * RE: [CSSWG] Minutes and Resolutions Paris F2F Monday Morning 2012-02-06: Administrivia, Vendor Prefixes, Property/Value Alias OM
    * when the actual message is just about prefixes or prefixed values etc.

good:
  * prefixed values(RE: [CSSWG] Minutes and Resolutions Paris F2F Monday Morning 2012-02-06: Administrivia, Vendor Prefixes, Property/Value Alias OM)

better:
