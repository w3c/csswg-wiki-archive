====== www-style Etiquette ======

The [[http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/|www-style mailing list]] is the primary forum for discussing the development of CSS.

Note: This does not mean development //with// CSS; for help with using CSS, see [[http://www.css-discuss.org/|css-discuss]] for that.

==== Start Subjects with Bracketed Topics/Specs ====

When writing an email to www-style about a particular spec, please summarize the topic in the subject line and start the subject with the spec code in brackets, e.g.
  * [css3-ui] text-overflow - what happens to overflow when you scroll
  * [CSS21] overconstrained fixed table layouts underdefined

The spec codes allow editors to more reliably track and address feedback on their specs, and help direct other interested people to the thread.

==== Interleave Replies ====

Interleave or bottom-post replies, and trim quotations to quote only relevant parts. Previous discussion is always available in full in the [[http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/|archive]].

==== Don't reply to announcements  ====

Occasionally a CSSWG member will post meeting minutes, a draft publication announcement, or a meeting agenda to the list. If you want to discuss one of the topics in the message, quote the relevant part and start a new thread with a new subject line. Only reply to the announcement thread if you're offering a correction or missing background info.

==== Change the subject when a starting new discussion ====

A lot of emails get posted to www-style which can spark new / specific discussions in subthreads. When replying any such email and following-up on a specific aspect or subject, please start a *new* subject with the particular topic in brackets. This helps people notice the topic change.

E.g. bad:
  * RE: [CSSWG] Minutes Telecon 2012-02-29
    * when the actual message is about a technical issue in the Animations spec

better:
  * animating vertical-align (RE: [CSSWG] Minutes Telecon 2012-02-29)

best:
  * [css3-animations] animating vertical-align (was RE: [CSSWG] Minutes Telecon 2012-02-29)
  * [css3-animations] animating vertical-align
