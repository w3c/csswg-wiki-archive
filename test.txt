====== Testing ======

Our conformance test suites: how to run them, known bugs, and how to contribute. The tests are maintained in the W3C's [[http://dev.w3.org/|dev.w3.org]] [[http://www.nongnu.org/cvs/|cvs]] repository.

Test suite discussion takes place on the [[http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-css-testsuite/|public-css-testsuite mailing list]]. The [[test:irc|#css-test channel]] on irc.w3.org:6665 is also available for discussion, and we have weekly IRC "Test Days" there on Wednesdays.
