====== Radial Gradient Wars ======

=== Syntax A ===
<code>
  <radial-gradient> = radial-gradient(
	[<position>,]? 
	[[
		[<shape> || <size>]
		|
		[<length> | <percentage>]{2}
	],]? 
	<color-stop>[, <color-stop>]+
  )
</code>

== Things an author has to learn with this syntax, not in linear-gradient: ==

  * Differences with similar-looking background syntax:
    * radial-gradient uses a comma instead of a slash to disambiguate between position and size, thus if you specify an explicit size, you must specify a position as well to disambiguate
    * the positioning argument positions the center of the gradient, not the top left (on the other hand, both lengths and percentages work the same way in gradients, but different ways in bg-position)
  * Two gradient lines (horizontal and vertical radii) instead of one (unless using 'circle' keyword). No getting around this in either syntax.
  * The 'cover' and 'contain' keywords have a similar, but not identical, meaning to the same keywords used in background-size.  Within a gradient they respond to the position of the gradient's center; in background-size, they don't care about the position of the image, only its size relative to the positioning area.


=== Syntax B ===
<code>
  <radial-gradient> = radial-gradient(
  	[ [ from <side-or-corner-or-center> ] ,]? [circle,]? <color-stop>[, <color-stop>]+
  )
  
  <side-or-corner-or-center> = [[left | right] || [top | bottom]] | center
</code>

If <side-or-corner-or-center> is omitted, or if it is 'center', then the gradient goes starts with the 0% color-stop in the center of the image, and the 100% color-stop aligned to the four edges. Otherwise, the gradient center is aligned with the indicated side(s), with 0% in the corner (if two sides are indicated) or in the middle of a side (if only one side is indicated) and extends out with 100% color-stop aligned to the other three sides.

If '%%[[center],]? circle%%', then the gradient's 100% color stop aligns with the two closest edges (which will be either the horizontal edges or the vertical edges). If '%%[[left | right] || [top | bottom]], center%%', then the gradient's 100% color stop aligns with the two closest edges other than those listed by the author in the color-gradient function.

<del>The 'circle' keyword sets the intrinsic ratio of the image to 1:1.</del> Actually I think I don't need this part.

== Key Points: ==

  * We usually do not add features without strong use cases, especially if it adds complexity to the syntax.
  * CSS distinguishes itself from SVG by being simpler and easier to learn, even though SCG offers more expressive power. That is a large reason why many more authors are able to pick up and learn CSS, most of whom may never learn any SVG. If we want to have vast expressive power at the cost of complexity and ease of learning, we already have that in SVG; we do not need to blur the lines between when CSS is needed and when SVG is needed. CSS for common needs fulfilled by a simple syntax, SVG for more complex and uncommon needs.
  * Radial gradients are a minor need compared to linear gradients; non-centered and/or clipped and/or explicitly-sized radial gradients are a minor subset of radial gradients; radial gradients in non-background images are an even more minor need, and needs for non-centered and/or clipped and/or explicitly-sized radial gradients within list-style-image or border-image are practically non-existant. Plus, authors are already using background properties instead of list-style-image, in order to have more control over position of the image. list-style-image's lack of precision control is its own problem, not the problem of radial-gradient.
  * Most of the extra power of Syntax A is simply not needed, as there are existing ways to move, size, and clip images. This is especially true for the most common case of background-image gradients, but is also true if we want to use radial gradients as 'content' values, or (I think) as part of SVG filters.
  * The need to draw little pictures to use as background patterns or as images for bullet points is already well served by SVG.
  * With linear-gradient, we simplified the syntax a lot, and this had a great effect, as linear-gradient is easy to learn and use. The hardest part of using linear-gradient is when you want to provide a fallback using the much more complex -webkit-gradient. 
  * With linear-gradient, we acknowledged that:
    *  gradients are generally fuzzy-edged things that do not need to precision-align with other elements, 
    * that color-stops (including those that are > 100%) were perfectly adequate for setting where gradients began and ended, 
    * that other properties (especially background properties) help to position and size the gradient in ways that it does not therefore need to do internally, and 
    * that always going edge to edge (or corner to corner) was a good simplification that improved the readability and understandability of the code. 
    * Syntax B brings these same principles to 'radial-gradient': it says that all radial gradients can go from center-to-edge, edge-to-edge, or corner to corner, and that color-stops (including those that are > 100%) are perfectly adequate for setting where gradients began and ended.

== Things an author has to learn with this syntax, not in linear-gradient: ==
  * Two gradient lines (horizontal and vertical radii) instead of one (unless using 'circle' keyword). No getting around this in either syntax.
  * Percentages are relative to both dimensions, fixed distances measured against horizontal only. This is in the more complex syntax too. 
  * <side-or-corner-or-center> and 'center' both have an effect on the gradient line length, but it is a very simple calculation (the centered gradients have half the gradient line length of the others; 'center' means you use the smaller dimension of either horizontal or vertical only).
