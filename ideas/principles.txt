====== Minor Principles of Design ======

  ; Transparency Principle
  : Inserting an unstyled block in a block formatting context (as sibling, parent, child or intermediary) / unstyled inline in an inline formatting context should have no effect on styling.
  ; Lea Verou Reordering Principle
  : If it can be unambiguously reordered, it should be reorderable.
  ; Pass-through Auto-sizing Principle
  : `auto` as a size generally passes down any min/max-content constraints, and passes up through it the min/max-content contribution
  ; Resolved Values Round-Trip Principle
  : If you write the result of ''getComputedStyle()'' back into the property, the resulting rendering of that element (inheritance aside) should remain stable.
  ; DBaron's Degrees of Freedom Caveat
  : When the platform has too many degrees of freedom in it, developers aren't able to test what they're doing well enough. [This results in buggy web pages, particularly on minority systems, and is therefore bad.]
  ; fantasai Principle of Proper Resilience
  : We try to make sure behavior is good by default, and resilient in weird cases. We do not choose bad behavior by default because it's the most straightforward way to be resilient.
  ; Jen Simmons Tooling Principle
  : Any feature that requires everyone to use a certain toolchain to be usable is a design failure.
  ; Roc Principle of Spec-writing
  : If Robert O'Callahan is unhappy with your spec, you're the one who's wrong.
