====== Minor Principles of Design ======

See [[https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/intro.html#design-principles|CSS2 Design Principles]], [[http://fantasai.inkedblade.net/weblog/2012/css-layout-evolution/#principles|Evolution of CSS Layout: Principles]], & [[http://fantasai.inkedblade.net/style/talks/designing-css/|Designing CSS slide deck]] for higher-level design principles.

  ; Transparency Principle
  : Inserting an unstyled block in a block formatting context (as sibling, parent, child or intermediary) / unstyled inline in an inline formatting context should have no effect on styling.
  ; Lea Verou Reordering Principle
  : If it can be unambiguously reordered, it should be reorderable.
  ; Pass-through Auto-sizing Principle
  : `auto` as a size generally passes down any min/max-content constraints, and passes up through it the min/max-content contribution
  ; Resolved Values Round-Trip Principle
  : If you write the result of ''getComputedStyle()'' back into the property, the resulting rendering of that element (inheritance aside) should remain stable.
  ; DBaron's Degrees of Freedom Caveat
  : When the platform has too many degrees of freedom in it, developers aren't able to test what they're doing well enough. [This results in buggy web pages, particularly on minority systems, and is therefore bad.]
  ; Roc Principle of Spec-writing
  : If Robert O'Callahan is unhappy with your spec, you're the one who's wrong.
