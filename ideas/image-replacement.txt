====== Image Replacement in CSS3 ======

Image replacement techniques are used on many websites today to replace text, such as a header, with an image of the text rendered in a fancy font. Methods range from image tags to background images with massing negative indentation, each with their own disadvantage.

The CSSWG has resolved to allow the `content` property on all elements in CSS3. This property can take a <uri>, creating a replaced element. In CSS3, `content` takes a comma-separated list, so that fallbacks can be specified. Here's an example:

<code css>
  /* Use image, failing that use element's content. */
  H1 { content: url(sparkly_heading_text.png), contents; }
</code>

===== Interaction with Fonts =====

We recognize, however, that the likely set of preferences for such headings would be:

  - Use the preferred font if it is installed on the system.
  - Otherwise download the font and use it, if possible.
  - Otherwise display the image in place of the contents, if possible.
  - Otherwise display the contents.

At the May 2006 face-to-face meeting, the CSSWG [[http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-css-wg/2006AprJun/0111.html|accepted a proposal]] from Ian to add a `require-font` function to the `content` property. The function would not create any content, but would trigger the next fallback if the fonts in its argument list (whether pre-installed or downloaded via `@font-face`) were not available for use.

The consensus on syntax was:

   Syntax:
      require-font
      require-font(<string>)
      require-font(<family-name>)
   Edge cases to cover:
      require-font()
      require-font(generic-name) (e.g. require-font(serif))

The `require-font` keyword would automatically take the first font in font-family as its implied argument. This is not merely syntactic sugar for the author, but also causes a user's font override, if any, to become the required font: in typical usage, this would disable the image replacement fallback and display the contents in the user's selected font.

A suggestion from Håkon was to imply the `contents` keyword if the `require-font` function were specified alone (with no content).

===== Unresolved Details =====

One proposal for `require-font()` was to make it the same as `require-font`. The other, which avoids creating an alias (which would be a pain for DOM-based editors), would interpret it as requiring the font named '' [the empty string], effectively always triggering the fallback. The third possibility would be to make it invalid, causing it to invalidate the entire property declaration.

It was assumed that `require-font(generic-name)` would always be true. However this needs to be specified: figuring out `require-font(serif)` on a system with only sans-serif fonts is not obvious.

===== Examples =====

A basic example from Ian, demonstrating a range of fallback possibilities.

<code html>
<h1>Hello World</h1>
</code>

...with one of:

<code css>
h1 { content: "Hello"; }
h1 { content: url(images/hello.png), "Hello"; }
h1 { content: url(images/hello.png); }
h1 { font-family: Zapfino, cursive;
     content: require-font("Zapfino") "Hello"; }
h1 { font-family: Zapfino, cursive;
     content: require-font("Zapfino") contents; }
h1 { font-family: Zapfino, cursive;
     content: require-font("Zapfino") contents, url(images/hello.png); }
h1 { font-family: Zapfino, Wingdings, Arial;
     content: require-font("Zapfino") require-font("Wingdings") contents, url(images/hello.png); }
</code>

Another example from Bert, demonstrating the advantage of separating the method of specifying a font (`font-family`) from requiring it (`require-font` on `content`):

<code html>
<h1>This is <span>huge!</span></h1>
</code>
<code css>
h1 span { font-family: biggy }
h1      { font-family: Times New Roman }
h1      { content: require-font(biggy) content, url(replacement.png) }
</code>
