===== CSS3 Floats =====

This page contains the issues that are not yet listed in the specification and the resolutions for issues that were in the spec. but got resolved.

There is a companion [[ideas:css3-floats-use-cases|use cases]] page.

===== Action Items =====

  * Editor. Add that we may consider having multiple shapes to define the inside and ouside shapes separately.
  * Editor. Add that we should have a 'wrap-shape-outline' or a 'stroke' property to let the user draw the outline of a wrap-shape
  * Editor. Clarify what happens when there are separate sub-shapes in an exclusion.

===== Issues =====

===== Issue 1: Processing model =====
 
Do one pass to position the exclusions. Then, do another pass with the exclusions present.

===== Issue 2: Exclusion trigger (what makes an element become an exclusion?) =====

Triggered with a single property that can specify that an inside or inside wrap-shape exists (or both), and how the content flows around the shape (for outside wrapping). Something like:

wrap-mode: default|none|inside|[outside-[left|right|both]|[all-[left+right+both]
initial: default
 
Need to define default wrap-mode to be compatible with current float behavior. For example, a 'float: left' should have its default computed wrap-mode be 'outside-right', a 'float: right' would be 'outside-left'.
===== Issue 3: Containment model =====
 
Use the containing block model of CSS.

===== Issue 4: Enabling or disabling exclusions =====

Rename flow-wrap to something different like 'external exclusions allowed'.
 
===== Issue 5: Ordering of exclusions =====
 
Same as z-index. Should we have a separate property or not?

Proposal: use the same z-index property because having both z-index and an additional property may create issues and create surprising results.
 
===== Issue 6: Positioning of exclusions =====
 
As defined in CSS2.
 
===== Issue 7: Shrink wrap of container with floats having wrap-shapes (inside) =====
 
The shrink wrap is done with the float's box.

===== Issue 8: should we use something else than 'wrap'? =====

The use of 'wrap' in properties such as 'wrap-type' or 'wrap-mode' may be confusing because of a different meaning for wrap in the FlexBox specification ('flex-wrap' property) see Flex Box [[spec:css3-flexbox:#issue-1|issues]].
