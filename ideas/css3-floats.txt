===== Action Items =====

  * Editor. Add that we may consider having multiple shapes to define the inside and ouside shapes separately.
  * Editor. Add that we should have a 'wrap-shape-outline' or a 'stroke' property to let the user draw the outline of a wrap-shape
  * Editor. Clarify what happens when there are separate sub-shapes in an exclusion.

===== Issues =====

==== Issue A ====

The use of 'wrap' in properties such as 'wrap-type' or 'wrap-mode' may be confusing because of a different meaning for wrap in the FlexBox specification ('flex-wrap' property) see Flex Box [[spec:css3-flexbox:#issue-1|issues]]
