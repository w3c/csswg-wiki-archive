====== Additional Pseudo-Elements ======


The ::outside pseudo-element was cut from css3-content and has not been tracked since. Other pseudo-elements concepts like wrapping a range of elements have been discussed from time to time. Additional pseudo-elements with more control over where they are positioned in the tree could help reduce markup clutter where elements are added to HTML for the sole purpose of CSS styling ([[http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2011Dec/0463.html|Markup Clutter thread]]) ([[http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2010Jul/0160.html|Thread discussing wrapping multiple elements]]).

Here is a list of possible pseudo-element additions that could be made in a future spec.

=== 1. Simple wrapping of a single element ===

In CSS3 Content, ''::outside'' was meant to create a pseudo element containing a single element

  <!-- pseudo-element -->
    <div>markup content</div>
  <!--end -->

=== 2. Complex wrapping of an element range ===

A wrapper that contains a range of elements specified by indices. This could be specified as a child interval on a parent (example: ''#parent::wrap(2,5)''), or directly from an element with a number of siblings to contain (example: ''#parent > :nth-child(2)::wrap(3)'').

  <div id=parent>
    <div>1</div>
    <!-- pseudo-element containing the next three elements -->
      <div>2</div>
      <div>3</div>
      <div>4</div>
    <!--end -->
    <div>5</div>
  </div>
  
If the second idea (starting from the first element to be wrapped, and specifying how many elements to include in the wrapping) is adopted, it could be used to solve #1 as well, by allowing an appropriate default value to wrap only the single element.  That is, something like ''div::wrap'' could be equivalent to ''div::wrap(1)'', which wraps only the single ''div''.

=== 3. Complex wrapping of selector range ===

A wrapper that contains a range of elements specified by selectors. In this case the declared range is from every <dt> element until the next <dt> following a <dd> (example: ''dl::wrap(:matches(:first-child, dt), dd+dt)'')

  <dl>
    <!-- pseudo-element -->
      <dt> Last modified time </dt>
      <dd> 2004-12-23T23:33Z </dd>
    <!-- end -->
    <!-- pseudo-element -->
      <dt> Recommended update interval </dt>
      <dd> 60s </dd>
    <!-- end -->
    <!-- pseudo-element -->
      <dt> Editors </dt>
      <dd> Robert Rothman </dd>
      <dd> Daniel Jackson </dd>
    <!-- end -->
  </dl>

=== 4. Sibling pseudo-elements ===

A pseudo-element as a previous or next sibling to an element. In the case below you should be able to place this pseudo-element as following <h1> or previous to <p> (example: ''h1::next'')

  <h1>heading</h1>
  <!-- pseudo-element -->
  <p>paragraph</p>
  
=== 5. Proliferation ===

Mechanisms for adding more than one pseudo-element in some or all of the existing pseudo-element schemes.  CSS3 Content previously had the ability to specify multiples of a pseudo by specifying an index, like ''::before[2]''.

  <div>
    <!-- ::before pseudo-element 1 -->
    <!-- ::before pseudo-element 2 -->
    markup content
  </div>
  
  <!-- nesting ::outside pseudo-element -->
    <!-- nesting ::outside pseudo-element -->
      <div>markup content</div>
    <!-- end -->
  <!-- end -->
  
  <h1>heading</h1>
  <!-- multiple sibling pseudo-elements -->
  <!-- multiple sibling pseudo-elements -->
  <!-- multiple sibling pseudo-elements -->
  <p>paragraph</p>  
  
=== 6. Complex wrapping of ranges of similar elements ===

A wrapper that contains contiguous elements that share a selectable characteristic. In this case, instead of making three simple wrappers around each instance of class bar, it would group the first two bar elements together in one wrapper (example: ''::wrap(div.bar)'')

  <div class=foo></div>
  <!-- pseudo-element that wraps class bar -->
    <div class=bar></div>
    <div class=bar></div>
  <!-- end -->
  <div class=foo></div>
  <!-- pseudo-element that wraps class bar -->
    <div class=bar></div>
  <!-- end -->
      
This could potentially also be addressed with #3, via something like ''::wrap(div.bar, :not(div.bar))''.
