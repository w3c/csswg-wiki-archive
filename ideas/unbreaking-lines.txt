====== Unbreaking Lines ======

HTML and CSS rely on “unbreaking” source code lines to create paragraphs. The original rules for this were very simple: line breaks in the source turn into spaces in the rendering. But this rule does not work for writing systems that don't use spaces, such as Chinese.

===== Use Cases ======

Formats that need to “unbreak” lines include:

  * HTML
  * XML/SGML
  * TeX/LaTeX
  * https://asciidoc.org/
  * Markdown

===== Standardization =====
