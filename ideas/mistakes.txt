====== List of Mistakes in the Design of CSS ======

That should be corrected if anyone invents a time machine. :P

  * ''white-space: nowrap'' should be ''white-space: no-wrap''
  * ''vertical-align'' should not apply to table cells. Instead the CSS3 alignment properties should exist in Level 1.
  * ''vertical-align: middle'' should be ''text-middle'' because it's not really in the middle.
  * Percentage heights should be calculated against ''fill-available'' rather than being undefined in auto situations.
  * Table layout should be sane.
  * Box-sizing should be ''border-box'' by default.
  * ''background-size'' with one value should duplicate its value, not default the second one to ''auto''.
  * ''z-index'' should be called ''z-order'' or ''depth'' and should Just Work on all elements (like it does on flex items).
  * ''word-wrap'' should have been called ''overflow-wrap'' from the beginning because it confuses everybody.
  * The top and bottom margins of a box should never have been allowed to collapse together automatically as this is the **root of all margin-collapsing evil**.
  * Partial collapsing of margins instead of weird rules to handle min/max-heights?
  * Tables (and other non-blocks, e.g. flex containers) should form pseudo-stacking contexts.
  * The ''currentcolor'' keyword should have a dash, ''current-color''.
  * There should have been a predictable color naming system instead of arbitrary X11 names.
