=== Spec Styling Effort ===


==== Requirements & Feedback ====

===== Dave Ragget on contrast ===== 

http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/FXTF/raw-file/tip/custom/index.html

The light blue color used for links is in my opinion too low a contrast
against the white page background, and some people (myself included)
will find the links hard to read.  You may want to look at the WAI
authoring accessibility guidelines for recommendations on colors and
contrasts.

===== Richard Ishida on content width ===== 

Please don't force me to work with a fixed width of text -
please make it a % of the window width so that I can widen by stretching the window if I want.

Although I do normally like a narrowish column for on-screen reading,
there are circumstances where I want to see more content at a time, and
I'd like to be able to do that by controlling, myself, how much of the
content i see.  Stretching the window allows me to do that.

The same goes for situations where I may want to compare multiple
windows on a screen - the fixed width of this column loses information
on the right side if I make my window too narrow.

====== Richard Ishida on Print ======

In addition, please provide an option to print specs without such narrow
columns. This is to save on paper. I often print out specs to review
them for i18n issues. It already takes up a lot of paper, and if this
fixed column width is forced on me for printing, I will probably use up
twice as much.

====== Karl Dubost ======

  * Adjustable line width for very small screen would be nice (Mediaqueries maybe)
  * "i like 100% width… then i resize my browser width to a decent size for me" (colleague comment)
  * Property table hard to read at the bottom. Need better style. The values seem to be floating.
  * Guidelines for schematic graphs would be a nice touch to add, so there is consistency between specs
  * Use of same color for links and code is a bit confusing.
  * I would add more space in between paragraphs but that might be me only :) difficult to breathe.
  
==== Daniel Glazman on body width ====

In the body of Vincent's spec, I suppose one given element, let's say
#main, has a fixed size through a width or max-width property. Something
like

   #main {
     max-width: 50em;
  }

Just tweak that to

   #main:target {
     max-width: 50em;
   }

and your document can have two different renderings for the regular URL
without fragment id and the one with #main fragment id.

   index.html      will be viweport-wide
   index.html#main will be 50em-wide
