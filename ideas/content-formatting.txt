Proposal (draft)

Add a CSS module for numbers

Use XSLT's format-number syntax as a starting ground

==== Intended purposes ====

   * i18n
   * Enhanced usability, without sacrificing accessibility or scriptability
   * Enhanced accessibility, without sacrificing usability or scriptability

==== Rationale ====

This is a question about visual presentation. As such it should be handled with CSS.
No other technology can be made media-specific.

==== New CSS rules ====

**@decimal-format** that draws its ideas from xsl:decimal-format

**number-format**   that draws its ideas from xsl:number-format


==== Example CSS ====
  @decimal-format phone {
    grouping-separator: " ";
  }
  @decimal-format price {
    grouping-separator: ",";
    decimal-separator : "."
  }
  @decimal-format sweprice {
    grouping-separator: " ";
    decimal-separator : ","
  }
  @media all {
    td.phone {
        number-format: "## ##", "phone";
    }
  }
  @media screen {
    td.price {
        number-format: "###,##0.00", "price";
        /* price is actually redundant as this format would be the default */
    }
    td.price::after {
        content: " USD";
    }
    td.sweprice {
        number-format: "### ##0,00", "sweprice";
    }
    td.sweprice::after {
        content: " SEK";
    }
  }
  @media speech {
    /* 
        Grouping both unnecessary and unwanted, words like
       "billion", "million" and "thousand" should be spelled out
    */ 
    td.price {
        number-format: "0.00", "price";
    }
    td.sweprice {
        number-format: "0,00", "sweprice";
    }
    td.price::after {
        content: " US dollars";
    }
    td.sweprice::after {
        content: " Swedish crowns";
    }
  }

==== Example HTML ====
  <span class="phone">123467</span>

Should be displayed and spoken as "12 34 56"

  <td class="price">987654321</td>

Should be displayed as [987,654,321.00 USD] and spoken as 
"nine hundred and eighty seven million six hundred and fifty four thousand three hundred and twenty
one point zero zero US dollars"

  <td class="sweprice">987654321</td>

Should be displayed as [987 654 321,00 SEK] and spoken as 
"nine hundred and eighty seven million six hundred and fifty four thousand three hundred and twenty
one **comma** zero zero Swedish crowns"

==== Remarks ====

If possible, it would be convenient to add number-format to cols and colgroups!

Additional inspiration:
  * mso-number-format
  * ICU

Note to HTML WG:
  * Add browser parsing rules
  * Purpose: Provide formatted HTML ouput as a fallback to older browsers

  - Remove all non numeric characters from the nodevalue, except the decimal separator.
  - Add that value to a DOM-property: E.numericValue

Example <td>$ 200,000</td> should be interpreted as 200000 so a script
could access the value.

In the abscence of CSS-rules that DOM-property could be used by assistive
technologies as well.

Perhaps the value could also be set as an attribute:
<td numericValue="43218765">43,218,765</td>
