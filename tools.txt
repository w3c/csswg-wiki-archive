====== CSSWG Tools ======

The CSSWG uses some tools to make our jobs easier. Here they are!

  * This DokuWiki (obviously)
  * [[http://www.w3.org/Mail/|W3C Mailing Lists]]: specifically [[http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/|www-style]] for our specs, [[http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-css-testsuite/|public-css-testsuite]] for testing, and [[http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-fx/|public-fx]] for specs we co-edit with the [[http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/|SVGWG]]. We also have an [[http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-css-wg/|internal list]] for administrivia.
  * [[tools:hg|Mercurial]] is the version control system we use for our [[spec|specs]] and our [[test|tests]].
  * [[https://www.w3.org/blog/CSS/wp-admin/|WordPress]] runs our [[http://www.w3.org/blog/CSS/|official blog]]
  * [[http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Tracker/|Tracker]], [[https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/|Bugzilla]], and [[spec|this wiki]] are used to track spec issues. (Newer specs will link to their issues list in the header.)

  * The CSS [[http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-module/Overview.src.html|module template]], [[https://www.w3.org/Style/Group/css3-src/bin/postprocess|Bert's post-processor]], and the [[http://www.w3.org/Style/Group/css3-src/biblio.ref|bibliographic data file]] are used to generate our specs. See [[tools:spec-processor]] for tips.
  * [[http://www.w3.org/2001/12/zakim-irc-bot|Zakim]] is a conference bridge with an IRC bot that helps us manage our telecons.
