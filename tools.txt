We also have an [[http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-css-wg/|internal list]] for administrivia.
  * [[tools:git|Git/GitHub]] or [[tools:hg|Mercurial]] can be used to access the version control system for our [[spec|specs]] and our [[test|tests]].

  * [[https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues|GitHub issues]] are used to track spec issues. (Older spec issues are found in the mail archives, and might be additionally tracked in [[https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Tracker/|CSS Tracker]], [[https://www.w3.org/Graphics/fx/track/|FXTF Tracker]], [[https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/|Bugzilla]], and [[spec|this wiki]].)
