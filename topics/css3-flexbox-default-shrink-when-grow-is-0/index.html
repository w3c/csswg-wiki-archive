=== Background ===

To address other issues, we changed the default for 'flex-shrink' from 0 to 1 during the F2F.

=== Problem Statement ===

The behavior of "flex: 0 <length>;" changes - it can now shrink, where before it couldn't.

=== Proposal(s) ===

  ; Proposal A : flex-shrink always gets reset to 1, even if flex-grow is 0.
  ; Proposal B : Make an omitted flex-shrink default to 0 if the flex-grow is given as 0 in the flex shorthand.

This issue ties in with the [[flex-initial-value]], whose outcome may affect what's sensible here.
