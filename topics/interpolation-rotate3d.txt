=== Background ===

The CSS WG asked for tests on the interpolation behavior for rotate3d.

=== Problem Statement ===

The current specification request browsers to fallback to matrix interpolation for rotate3d. The CSS WG asked for interpolation tests to check the current behavior on browsers.

I wrote different tests for behavior checking on rotate3d with CSS animation. Since we don't have automated testing, the tests needed to be run manually. I tested the following interpolation scenarios on IE 10pre, FF nightly, Chromium nighlty, Safari6 on 8/10/2012:

==== rotate3d ====
none -> rotate3d(0,0,1,360deg)
  * no rotation on all browsers
rotate3d(0,0,1,45deg) -> rotate3d(0,0,1,405deg)
  * no rotation on all browsers
  * clockwise rotation by one turn on Chromium
rotate3d(0,0,-1,45deg) -> rotate3d(0,0,1,405deg)
  * clockwise rotation by 90deg on all browsers
rotate3d(0,0,2,45deg) -> rotate3d(0,0,2,405deg)
  * no rotation on all browsers
rotate3d(0,0,2,45deg) -> rotate3d(0,0,6,405deg)
  * no rotation on all browsers
rotate3d(0,0,4,45deg) -> rotate3d(0,0,-4,405deg)
  * anti-clockwise rotation by 90deg on all browsers

==== rotateZ ====
rotateZ(45deg) -> rotate3d(0,0,1,405deg)
  * no rotation on all browsers
rotateZ(45deg) -> rotateZ(405deg)
  * rotation on all browsers
rotate3d(0,0,1,45deg) -> rotateZ(405deg)
  * no rotation on all browsers
rotate3d(0,0,2,45deg) -> rotateZ(405deg)
  * no rotation on all browsers
rotateZ(45deg) -> rotate3d(0,0,2,405deg)
  * no rotation on all browsers

I did more tests with different variations as well (rotateX) and come to the same conclusion:
All browsers but Chrome do matrix interpolation when rotate3d is involved. Chrome tries numerical interpolation if 'from' is either rotate3d(0,0,1, <angle>), rotate3d(0,1,0, <angle>) or rotate3d(1,0,0, <angle>). But even Chrome does not interpolate numerically if the length of the vector is not 1.

=== Proposal(s) ===
Keep current specification text: when rotate3d is involved, the rotation gets interpolated by matrix decomposing.
