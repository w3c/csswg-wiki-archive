=== Background ===

Like XSL:FO, CSS uses the terms ''start'' and ''end'' to distinguish the two logical inline-axis directions. Lacking any better proposals, we've been using XSL:FO's ''before''/''after'' to distinguish the two logical block-axis directions. People generally aren't thrilled with these terms: they are not distinct, and the two pairs are therefore confusable. But there haven't been any compelling alternatives... until now.

=== Problem Statement ===

Rename the terms we are using for the two logical block-axis directions,, ''before''/''after'', to make them more obvious and less confusable with the inline-axis ''start''/''end''.

=== Proposal(s) ===

Christoph posted [[http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2012May/1046.html|several suggestions]], and the pair ''head''/''foot'' has gotten some traction.
