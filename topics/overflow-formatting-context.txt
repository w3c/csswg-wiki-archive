=== Problem Statement ===

The ''overflow'' property says it only applies to block containers, but it should also apply to tables and flex containers

=== Proposal ===

In 11.1.1 (Overflow), replace:

   # Applies to: block containers

with:

   | Applies to: block containers and boxes that establish a formatting context

In 9.4 (Normal flow), replace:

   # Boxes in the normal flow belong to a formatting context, which may
   # be block or inline, but not both simultaneously. Block-level boxes
   # participate in a block formatting context. Inline-level boxes
   # participate in an inline formatting context.

with:

   | Boxes in the normal flow belong to a formatting context, which in
   | CSS21 may be block, inline or table. In future levels of CSS, other
   | types of formatting context will be introduced. Block-level boxes
   | participate in a block formatting context. Inline-level boxes
   | participate in an inline formatting context. Table formatting
   | contexts are described in the chapter on _tables_.

In 17.4 (Tables in the visual formatting model), replace:

   # [...] The table wrapper box establishes a block formatting context.
   # [...]

with:

   | [...] The table wrapper box establishes a block formatting context,
   | and the table box establishes a table formatting context. [...]

In 17.5 (Visual layout of table contents), replace:

   # Internal table elements generate rectangular boxes with content and
   # borders. Cells have padding as well. Internal table elements do not
   # have margins.

with:

   | Internal table elements generate rectangular boxes which
   | participate in the table formatting context established by the
   | table box. These boxes have content and borders, and cells have
   | padding as well. Internal table elements do not have margins.
