=== Background ===

The 'flex-order' property "reorders" flexbox items, allowing them to display independently of their source order.

=== Problem Statement ===

Does this reordering affect painting order?  That is, given the following markup:

''<flexbox>
  <a style="flex-order:2;">foo</a>
  <b style="flex-order:1;">bar</b>
</flexbox>''

If the <b> child overlaps the <a> child, should it paint above (that is, according to its source order) or below (according to its display order)?

=== Proposal(s) ===

A. 'flex-order' affects the painting order - items moved earlier paint underneath items moved later.

B. 'flex-order' has no effect on painting order - the original source order determines whether things are painted above/below others. 

=== Resolution ===

Resolved on A.
