=== Background ===

To address other issues, we changed the default for 'flex-shrink' from 0 to 1 during the F2F.

=== Problem Statement ===

The behavior of "flex: 0 <length>;" changes - it can now shrink, where before it couldn't.

=== Proposal(s) ===

We propose to make an omitted flex-shrink default to 0 if the flex-grow is given as 0 in the flex shorthand.
