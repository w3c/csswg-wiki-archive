=== Background ===

Fundamentally, we're breaking down the properties along two axes:

   * in which dimension are things being shifted? There are two:
       * X) inline (main)
       * Y) stacking (cross)

   * what's being aligned within what?
       * A) element itself within its containing block
       * B) element's contents within itself
       * C) element's child items within their container

We're going with 'justify' vs. 'align' to distinguish X vs. Y, but still need a scheme for A/B/C

=== Problem Statement ===

What naming scheme do we use to indicate various alignment targets?

=== Proposal(s) ===

See http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-align/#overview

If we don't have a clear consensus, we can pick something now and leave it open as an LC issue to give us more time.

Set 1: Box/Content/Default

    +--------X----------------Y------
  A |     box-justify      box-align
  B | content-justify  content-align
  C | default-justify  default-align


Set 2: Self/Content/Item

    +--------X----------------Y------
  A |    self-justify     self-align
  B | content-justify  content-align
  C |    item-justify     item-align


Set 3: Outside/Inside/Items

    +--------X----------------Y------
  A | justify-outside  align-outside
  B | justify-inside   align-inside
  C | justify-items    align-items

Set 4: Self/Content/Items Inversion

   +--------X----------------Y------
 A | justify-self     align-self
 B | justify-content  align-content
 C | justify-items    align-items

Set 5: Self/Content/Items Inline/Stack

   +--------X----------------Y------
 A | inline-align-self     stack-align-self
 B | inline-align-content  stack-align-content
 C | inline-align-items    stack-align-items

=== Summary of Comments ===

Anton:

  For me, Set 1 is too abstract. (Which box? Which default?)  I like
  self/content/item because I find it very self-descriptive.  I like
  outside/inside/items because it will match nicely with our future
  display-inside and display-outside.  I wouldn't have trouble
  remembering and applying the property names in Set 2 or Set 3.

Florian:

  box and content make sense to me, and so do outside and inside.
  self and content are a bit cryptic to me.
  As for default vs item, no strong opinion. Neither seem very much
  clearer than the other. 

Remy:

  outer-align; outer-justify;
  inner-align; inner-justify;
  child-outer-align; child-outer-justify;

  However, I'm not completely sold to "child-outer-align" and "child-outer-justify".
  This case is better solved with a pseudo-class. 

Tab:

  [Set 3] is my favorite.
  
  For one, I value the swapped ordering.  Having "justify" and "align"
  come first makes more sense to me, given our general rules for how
  alignment works.  It also puts us slightly farther away from the
  existing text/vertical-align properties, which is good.
  
  For two, outside/inside is very difficult to confuse, especially as we
  introduce more things using the inside/outside pair.

Alan:

  [Set 3] is my choice as well. Grouping these related properties together
  with justify and align coming first makes the most sense to me.
  I vastly prefer items [over default], as that conveys to me a group of
  discrete things to distribute.
  And I have a slight preference for inside/outside over self/content.
  I do not think 'box' should be used - it's too overloaded as a term.
  So I think this should be the easiest set to explain to someone new to
  the concepts.

dbaron:

  I'm actually not so happy about the *-outside terms here.  The
  display-outside/inside distinction is about two halves of the same
  thing; here' align-outside and align-items are about the same
  behavior, on different things.

Christoph:

  The “Inversion” row makes some sense, because ‘justify-box’/‘align-box’
  sound like English phrases in the imperative mood, whereas ‘box-justify’/
  ‘box-align’ sound odder (to me as a non-native speaker) than
  ‘box-justification’/‘box-alignment’.

  ‘default-*’ seems just wrong, not least because of the ‘default’ keyword.

  I think ‘box’ and ‘content’ are good terms and without doing further
  reading (and thinking), I’m not sure why we need to be able to specify
  the default box alignment for items.

  Regarding ‘outside’ and ‘inside’ (or maybe ‘outer’ and ‘inner’) I think
  the latter as proposed doesn’t match my mental model, which makes me prefer

    +--------X--------------Y--------
  A | justify-outside  align-outside
  B | justify[-self]   align[-self]
  C | justify-inside   align-inside

Lea:

  The align- and justify- prefixes are confusing to me too,
  especially the latter. However, I understand the concerns
  against using "horizontal" and "vertical" in the name.
  How about using the axes in the naming? i.e. inline-align-*
  and stacking-align-* (the latter could just be align-*).
  
  I also find "-inside" and "-outside" unintuitive. self/content
  sounds the most straightforward to me. inside/outside can mean
  a number of different things (align the element based on the
  outside? Align what's outside the element? Something else?)
  but self/content are not as prone to misinterpretation. Of
  course, introducing more inside/outside pairs in CSS helps,
  by forming a convention, but it does not change the fact that
  it's incomprehensible without that convention, which needs to
  be learned.

  However, opinions (even justified ones) are pointless when the
  problem is basically a usability issue (naming is to languages/
  APIs what UI is to applications). You need to conduct some sort
  of usability test [...]

fantasai:

  I think I'm leaning towards this myself, since it seems to fit
  reasonably well with the flexbox model:

  Set on flex container:
    align-content   - to set distribution of flex lines 
    justify-content - to set distribution of items in each flex line
    align-items     - to set (default) cross-position of items
  Set on flex item:
    align-self      - to set individual cross-position of item

=== Conclusions ===

  * People seem to be leaning towards the inverted variants.
  * A few people like "box", but several others think it's overloaded.
  * There seems to be general agreement that 'items' is better than 'default' (or the previous alternative, 'child').
  * There are concerns about the 'inside'/'outside' pair being too cryptic or too confusable, and lacking parallel with 'items'.
  * Some concern over align vs. justify being unmemorable and undescriptive.
