=== Background ===

Fundamentally, we're breaking down the properties along two axes:

   * in which dimension are things being shifted? There are two:
       * X) inline (main)
       * Y) stacking (cross)

   * what's being aligned within what?
       * A) element itself within its containing block
       * B) element's contents within itself
       * C) element's child items within their container

We're going with 'justify' vs. 'align' to distinguish X vs. Y, but still need a scheme for A/B/C

=== Problem Statement ===

What naming scheme do we use to indicate various alignment targets?

=== Proposal(s) ===

See http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-align/#overview

If we don't have a clear consensus, we can pick something now and leave it open as an LC issue to give us more time.
