=== Background ===

There are three possible behaviors for distributing items evenly along an axis:

**Edges flush**

   |[item]<-------->[item]<-------->[item]|

**Equal spacing**

   |<--->[item]<--->[item]<--->[item]<--->|

**Equal margins**

   |<-->[item]<---->[item]<---->[item]<-->|

Note: In Flexbox, you can get the equal-margins effect with ''auto'' margins, but only if you want the minimum spacing to be zero. Which might be sufficient for this level, but would be a candidate for future extension.

Related prior art:

  * ''text-justify: distribute;        /* edges flush */''
  * ''ruby-align: distribute-letter;   /* edges flush */''
  * ''ruby-align: distribute-space;    /* equal margins */''
  * ''background-repeat: space;        /* edges flush */''


=== Problem Statement ===

Flexbox currently uses ''justify'' to mean "edges flush" and ''distribute'' to mean "equal margins". This has two problems:
  * It's unclear from the names which is which.
  * The ''distribute'' value of ''text-justify'' means "edges flush", which is inconsistent.

We need keywords (or at least two, really, since only two are wanted) that clearly and unambiguously specify each of the behaviors.

=== Proposal(s) ===

  ; Proposal A : ''distribute'' vs. ''distribute-space''
  ; Proposal B : ''distribute-flush'' vs. ''distribute-space''
