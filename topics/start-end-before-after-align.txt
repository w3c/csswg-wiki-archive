=== Background ===

The alignment properties are divided into two dimensions, one for each flow-relative dimension. In order to have terms for all four sides of a box, the terminology used in each dimension is different: the inline dimension uses start/end, while the stacking dimension uses before/after. Right now the layout specs proposing new alignment properties use start/end keywords in both dimensions.

Note: Flexbox will be the first spec to go to CR with logical keywords.

=== Problem Statement ===

Should alignment properties use flow-relative terms, or use start/end in both dimensions?

=== Proposal(s) ===

The proposal is to have the Box Alignment proposal's '-align' properties, which align in the stacking dimension, to use before/after, not start/end.

This would impact Flexbox's three cross-axis alignment properties (currently named 'flex-align', 'flex-item-align', and 'flex-line-pack') and Grid Layout's one column-axis alignment property (called 'grid-row-align'). Note the properties will also be renamed when aligned to match Box Alignment.
