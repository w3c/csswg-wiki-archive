would recommend it, but I think it's ipnmrtaot that people have a realistic expectation of how this device works.  The Flex Belt works as claimed (strengthens and firms abs) however it isn't a silver bullet weight loss solution. If you're in reasonably good﻿ shape and want to firm up your abs this device works. However if you're 20 pounds over weight and expect to have a six pack in 6 weeks without changing your diet or doing other exercise then save your money.
