=== Background ===

There's been a lot of discussion lately (after the Hamburg F2F) on what the initial values of 'flex' should be, and there are some concerns raised by Ojan with the resolution recorded there.

=== Problem Statement ===

What are the best initial values for flex?

=== Proposal(s) ===

== Proposal A: ''flex: none'' ==

  * Pros
    * It's easier to use alignment and auto margins
    * Easier for use cases that want some but not most items flexible, e.g. one item takes up all free space
  * Cons
    * Doesn't have negative flexibility be default, which could help prevent overflow in many cases
    * Inconsistent with 'stretch' default in cross-dimension

== Proposal B: ''flex: auto'' ==

  * Pros
    * Negative flex is on by default, preventing overflow in many cases
    * Consistent with 'stretch' default in cross-dimension
  * Cons
    * Harder to use alignment and margins, since have to turn off flex first
    * More work for use cases that want most items inflexible

== Proposal C: ''flex: 0 1 auto'' ==

  * Pros
    * Negative flex is on by default, preventing overflow in many cases
    * Easy to use alignment and auto margins since positive free space is not flexed
    * Easy for use cases where free space is distributed to e.g. only one item
  * Cons
    * Inconsistent with 'stretch' default in cross-dimension
