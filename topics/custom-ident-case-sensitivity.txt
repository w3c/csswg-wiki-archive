=== Background ===

So, we resolved to make user-defined identifiers (like counter-names and namespace
prefixes) case-sensitive to avoid dealing with Unicode case-folding and other
complications.

This is fine for things that are entirely user-defined, like counters and namespace
prefixes, but Tab noticed that it presents a problem when we get to counter-styles:
all our styles right now are predefined keywords, and are thus case-insensitive
ASCII. When we use @counter-style to define counter styles, we will be allowing
users to create their own counter styles. Will those be case-sensitive? What if the
user redefines an existing counter-style?

=== Problem Statement ===

When UA identifiers (insensitive) and user identifiers (sensitive) co-exist, and UA identifiers are defined in terms of user-defined syntax (e.g. @counter-style), what is the case-sensitivity story?

=== Proposal(s) ===

Various options:

  - @counter-style names are always case-insensitive
     - via Unicode case-folding
     -  via ASCII case-insensitivity
  - @counter-style names are always case-sensitive; UA-defined keywords are simply defined for all case permutations. (Overriding one only overrides the permutation given.)
  - @counter-style names are case-sensitive, except those on the UA-defined list are special and are ASCII case-insensitive.
