=== Background ===

So, we resolved to make user-defined identifiers (like counter-names and namespace
prefixes) case-sensitive to avoid dealing with Unicode case-folding and other
complications.

This is fine for things that are entirely user-defined, like counters and namespace
prefixes, but Tab noticed that it presents a problem when we get to counter-styles:
all our styles right now are predefined keywords, and are thus case-insensitive
ASCII. When we use @counter-style to define counter styles, we will be allowing
users to create their own counter styles. Will those be case-sensitive? What if the
user redefines an existing counter-style?

=== Problem Statement ===

When UA identifiers (insensitive) and user identifiers (sensitive) co-exist, and UA identifiers are defined in terms of user-defined syntax (e.g. @counter-style), what is the case-sensitivity story?

=== Proposal(s) ===

Various options:

  - @counter-style names are always case-insensitive
     - via Unicode case-folding
     - via ASCII case-insensitivity
     - via Unicode lowercasing
     - Something else?
  - @counter-style names are always case-sensitive; UA-defined keywords are simply defined for all case permutations. (Overriding one only overrides the permutation given.)
  - @counter-style names are case-sensitive, except those on the UA-defined list are special and are ASCII case-insensitive.

=== Summary of Discussion ===

[[http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2012May/0509.html|Simon Sapin writes]]:

  I’d prefer to avoid 1A. because Unicode case-folding is very easy to 
  implement almost-but-not-quite right, and depends on a locale. (Eg. in 
  Python it is tempting to use the 'lower' or 'upper' method of Unicode 
  objects, but these only map codepoints one-to-one and are not proper 
  case folding.)
