**Spec:** css-compositing | **Owner:** cabanier | **Status:** Resolved | **Added:** 2012-07-27 | **Action:** Publish WD of the CSS compositing and blending specification | **Proposal:** [https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/FXTF/rawfile/tip/compositing/index.html](https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/FXTF/rawfile/tip/compositing/index.html)

#### Background

The CSS blending and compositing spec was approved as a WD on 2012-07-25 by the SVG Working group. Since this spec is part of the FX working group and it primarily introduces new CSS keywords, it also need to be approved by the CSS WG.

Please move the spec to working draft.
