# CSS Working Group Wiki

The CSS Working Group is the [W3C](http://www.w3.org/) working group chartered to develop [Cascading Style Sheets](http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/) (CSS). We are responsible both for the CSS specifications and for their [conformance test suites](https://wpt.fyi/results/css). Our [roadmap](http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/current-work) is maintained on the W3C website. fantasai has separately documented [how we work](http://fantasai.inkedblade.net/weblog/2011/inside-csswg/).

This wiki is to help the CSSWG record [resolutions](./ideas/ "ideas") and open [issues](./spec/ "spec"), to share them with public, and to encourage public involvement in the development of CSS and its [test suites](./test/ "test"). Contributions to this wiki are governed by the [Contributor Guidelines](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) and [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Note that editing is restricted to CSS Working Group members except in the Testing section (which is open to all).

The CSS Working Group welcomes your feedback on our work! Public discussion of our specs happens in github issues on the in [csswg-drafts](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/), [fxtf-drafts](https://github.com/w3c/fxtf-drafts/), and [css-houdini-drafts](https://github.com/w3c/css-houdini-drafts/) repositories (corresponding to [CSS drafts](https://drafts.csswg.org/index.html), [FXTF drafts](https://drafts.fxtf.org/), and [Houdini drafts](https://drafts.css-houdini.org/)) and on the archived [www-style](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/) mailing list, while maintenance of our test suites happens on [WPT GitHub](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/). Minutes of our meetings and publishing updates are posted to the [CSS WG Blog](http://www.w3.org/blog/CSS/). See list of [communications](./communications/ "communications") channels.

The working group uses the [planning](./planning/ "planning") page to coordinate topics for our face-to-face meetings.
