# Discussion

The CSS Working Group welcomes your feedback on our work. Public discussion of our specs happens on the archived [www-style](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/) mailing list, while discussion of our test suites happens on [public-css-testsuite](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-css-testsuite/). If you are part of a W3C Member organization, you can also access our [internal mailing list](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-css-wg/).
