==== Travel ====

**Airports**: Most travelers will want to fly to Toronto Pearson International Airport (**YYZ**), which is the largest and busiest airport in Canada.  However, if you're coming from somewhere in Eastern Canada or the Northeast US, you may want to consider flying to Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport (**YTZ**), which is near the city centre.
