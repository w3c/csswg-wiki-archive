### Agenda

#### Monday

##### AM

- the CSS OM needs major love. We can't extend the OM from multiple Level 3 and 4 specs without having a stable basis there.
- GCPM bookmarks. Can we have bookmark-level:auto work from the structure of the document?
- CSS-Style-Attribute: updating the REC for markup problems: <http://www.w3.org/mid/737F97AF-69E2-41DD-A047-E71012B81B71@rivoal.net>
- inline character grid (for CJK)
- Fonts
  - font-weight-adjust (<http://www.w3.org/mid/F1E15038-FA2D-485D-B328-089293E691AC@rivoal.net>)
- CSS Box Alignment Dramatic Reading aka Line by Line Review aka Issue Egg Hunt (may be evaded by finding sufficient Issue Eggs ahead of time, in which case we can have an issue-solving session instead)
- Developer Meet-up at the Sydney ftf?

##### PM

- wide gamut / deep color
- Scroll Snap
- Logical Syntax
  - Cascading
  - Naming
  - Positioning Syntax
  - Other issues
- May and August 2016 face-to-face meetings (or just one in June?) (TPAC is in September!)

#### Tuesday

##### AM

- CSS Fragmentation Issues <https://drafts.csswg.org/css-break/issues-lc-2015#issue-24>
- polar issues (prefers early AM Tuesday inc. device-radius MQ)
  - polar-distance with 2 values, polar-anchor, polar-orientation, methods to prevent overflow
- device-radius MQ (<https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2015Oct/0075.html>):
  - What is the % in device-radius relative to?
  - defining how inequalities work

##### PM

- take advantage of having all editors in the same room to have clearer status for all specs: where are we, ETA for next stage, how long did they remain at current stage, active editor or not, current work, etc.
- even if the above does not work, refine priorities based on spec importance and current spec status; are there abandoned or semi-abandoned specs?
- some specs in the scope of the new Web Platform Working Group will require liaison with our WG. How can do better liaising with that new WG than with the former HTML WG?
- Shadow DOM Styling - Tuesday 15:00-16:00 in WebApps room
- following up yesterday’s wide gamut discussion, agenda+ what should we do with <https://drafts.csswg.org/css-color-correction/>
- css-animations issues
