===== Pandemic Protocol =====

**Remember you are responsible for keeping yourself AND OTHERS safe.**

  * You must be vaccinated to the maximum eligible extent to attend.
  * Avoid close contact with people outside your household for 3 days prior to travel.
  * Wear an N95 mask during travel. Keep it on in the airport; have your drinks and snacks in-flight on the airplane only.
  * Do not dine indoors after you arrive. There's plenty of outdoor seating in NYC; pick a venue whose seating is actually open to the air.
  * Wear an N95/KN95/KF94 mask in all public indoor spaces (even though others might not).
  * Get a PCR test before you show up on Monday. If you didn't need to get one before travel, there are plenty of booths on the sidewalks of NYC that offer <24hr turnaround, so you can get one after you arrive (which is more useful anyway).
  * You will take a rapid test every morning. They're roughly $10 at the local pharmacies.
  * Depending on the state of the pandemic, we might all take a PCR one of the mornings.
  * Our meeting space has windows! We will be keeping them open for cross-ventilation. Be prepared for hot humid weather! Also be prepared for A/C because lots of buildings in NYC will be robustly cooled...
  * Jen Simmons will dictate our masking policy. :)
