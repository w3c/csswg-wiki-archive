==== Proposed Topics ====

  * CSS 3.1 (TabAtkins> SimonSapin and I have a planned project to publish a "CSS 3.1" module that is just all the parts of 2.1 that haven't been obsoleted by anything else yet. We'd whittle it down until it was empty.)

    * animation triggers and timebase
    * scroll-delay
    * beforescroll
    * snap-points
  * Status of [[spec:css2.2|CSS 2.2 test suite]] (i.e., tests for the CSS 2.1 errata)
  * Test suites and what spec to focus on next (Hopefully a quick topic)
  * CSS Sizing: [[http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2014Oct/0138.html|Indefinite percentage margins and padding]]

    * animation-behaviour (CSS Animations Level 4)
  * Floating inline-blocks in a shrink-to-fit context interop issue
  * CSS Grid: fragmentation, collapsing and open issues
  * CSS Fonts:
    * [[http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2013Oct/0346.html|classification of Kai as cursive]] [jdaggett: don't think this requires group discussion]

    * review of the custom MQ stuff
    * what to call "the ICB or the page area" for the purpose of the overflow-* features
    * scroll-position MQ (don't think we should do it, but we should discuss how to address the use-cases)
  * CSS Transforms
    * Issue with percentage (e.g. calc(0% + 20px) ) on transform-origin for SVG
    * Feedback on new spec text for 3D rendering (incl. preserve-3d)
