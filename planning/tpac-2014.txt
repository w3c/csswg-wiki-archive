==== Proposed Topics ====

  * CSS 3.1 (TabAtkins> SimonSapin and I have a planned project to publish a "CSS 3.1" module that is just all the parts of 2.1 that haven't been obsoleted by anything else yet. We'd whittle it down until it was empty.)
  * Scroll linked effects
  * Status of [[spec:css2.2|CSS 2.2 test suite]] (i.e., tests for the CSS 2.1 errata)
  * Test suites and what spec to focus on next (Hopefully a quick topic)
  * CSS Sizing: [[http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2014Oct/0138.html|Indefinite percentage margins and padding]]
  * CSS Sizing: The intrinsic block-size is a lie
  * css-animations: remaining issues at https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/buglist.cgi?component=Animations&list_id=46032&product=CSS&query_format=advanced&resolution=---
  * Floating inline-blocks in a shrink-to-fit context interop issue
  * CSS Grid: fragmentation, collapsing and open issues
  * CSS Fonts: [[http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2013Oct/0346.html|classification of Kai as cursive]]
  * flexbox issues
    * details?
  * Snap-points
  * Split layout/visual viewport
  * MediaQueries
    * continue a11y discussion from last meeting (high-contrast stuff)
    * names of the overflow-* features
    * review of the custom MQ stuff
    * what to call "the ICB or the page area" for the purpose of the overflow-* features
    * scroll-position MQ (don't think we should do it, but we should discuss how to address the use-cases)
  * CSS Transforms
    * Issue with percentage (e.g. calc(0% + 20px) ) on transform-origin for SVG
    * Feedback to preserve3d from UAs?
  * Motion Path (FXTF topic)
