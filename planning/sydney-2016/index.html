=== Network ===

The GoogleGuest network will be available throughout the building. No password is required.
==== Travel to/from airport ====

A taxi from the airport to the meeting venue will cost between $30 and $50, depending on traffic. There's generally only a short wait to get a taxi, and a fairly orderly queue. This is probably the most convenient, and also the cheapest if you share with others...

If staying in Chinatown, the [[http://www.airportlink.com.au/directions/sydney-city.php|airport train line]] is reasonably convenient. A one-way ticket is $16.40. If you're staying in Pyrmont, you can still take the train, then jump on the [[http://www.sydneylightrail.transport.nsw.gov.au/|light rail]] from 'Central' to 'the Star'. You'll need to pay $4.60 (in cash) after boarding the train.

Some hotels offer complimentary bus transfers to/from the airport - check with your hotel when booking.

=== Money ===

The [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_dollar|Australian dollar (AUD)]].  See [[http://www.oanda.com/currency/table?exch=AUD&sel_list=USD_EUR_GBP_JPY_NOK_SEK_NZD_CNY_TWD_KRW&value=1&format=HTML&redirected=1|exchange rates]].

You should be able to use your credit card pretty much everywhere (especially Mastercard and Visa). Diners Club cards tend to attract a fee or not be accepted. Checks are not generally accepted.

=== Electricity ===

230V, 50Hz, 10A [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AS/NZS_3112|flat, angled awesome pins]]

{{https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7a/Australian_dual_switched_power_point.jpg}}

Notice the small switch on the side. Unless you flip it on, don't expect the power socket to do much for you.
