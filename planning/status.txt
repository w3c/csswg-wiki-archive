====== Specification Status Scratchspace ======

This is scratch space for tracking the state of the CSS specs and what needs to be done for each. **It is not an exhaustive to-do list.** It's mainly used to track CSSWG-assigned items, though editors might also add their own items occasionally. (Other to-do items are stored on www-style, various issue-trackers, dispositions of comments, and editors' heads.)

It was last updated on 20 September 2017 and tracks backwards through about August 2013 or so.
