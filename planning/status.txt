  ; Containment
  : [[https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2016Mar/0039.html|Resolved: Accept #3 from the e-mail (Overflow is allowed visually, but it doesn’t project its “geometry” past the layout-contained ancestor, so it can’t trigger overflow past a layout-containment boundary) and say hit testing is currently undefined.]]
  : [[https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2016Mar/0039.html|Resolved: Mark the undefined hit testing as an issue.]]
  : [[https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2016Feb/0183.html|ACTION TabAtkins ask his implementor about layout containment and overflow.]]

  ; Flexbox

  : [[https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2016Mar/0173.html|fantasai gave a brief overview of the feedback that came from the New York grid workshop. She’ll be updating the spec and filing issues to the list.]]
  : [[https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2016Jan/0031.html|Resolved: Accept the new text for grid and multi-col changing the floor to a required amount. The new text is: “For the purpose of finding the number of auto-repeated tracks, the UA must floor the track size to a UA-specified value to avoid division by zero. It is suggested that this floor be ”1px” or less.”]]

  ; Input Modality
  : [[https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2015Sep/0112.html|Resolved: bkardell as editor of new ED for input modality (name pending)]]

  ; Overflow 3

  ; Misc
  : TabAtkins brought his proposal to address the possibility of font name being duplicated inside and outside a shadow DOM. The proposal would create a mapping where the external font is translated into a guaranteed unique name when passed into the shadow DOM. dbaron raised the possibility of instead using a function that gets the name from the scope, which was a cleaner solution. TabAtkins will write-up a new proposal using functions and send it to the mailing list for review.

  ;Multicol 1
  :https://www.w3.org/blog/CSS/2015/09/14/minutes-paris-f2f-2015-08-25-part-i/|Resolved: Drop break-before and break-after from Multicol and reference fragmentation definitions and republish as CR/]]

  : [[https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2016Jan/0145.html|Resolved: If previously snapped, must resnap to that same snap position after content changes (if possible). If not snapped previously and now in range of a snap position, must snap. After the above resolution, there was concern about the second sentence.]]
  : [[https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2016Jan/0145.html|Resolved: The second sentence of the previous resolution is not precise enough]]

  : [[https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2015Oct/0012.html|Resolved: Add :focus-ring to Selectors 4 or 5.]]
  ; [[https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2015Sep/0111.html|Resolved: Keep section 3.6.3. (Pseudo-classing Pseudo-elements) overall. Add guidance to people developing new pseudo-elements on when to specify if they accept user action pseudo-classes. Remove the statement from :hover that it applies to all pseudo-elements: pseudo-elements must individually enable pseudo-classes they need.]]
