  ; Misc
  : TabAtkins brought his proposal to address the possibility of font name being duplicated inside and outside a shadow DOM. The proposal would create a mapping where the external font is translated into a guaranteed unique name when passed into the shadow DOM. dbaron raised the possibility of instead using a function that gets the name from the scope, which was a cleaner solution. TabAtkins will write-up a new proposal using functions and send it to the mailing list for review.
