  : Default alignment issue
  : Finish line-by-line review
  : New draft?
  : [[https://www.w3.org/blog/CSS/2015/04/09/minutes-telecon-243/|Resolved: Accept Myles’ proposal to make baseline of overflow non-visible inline blocks the higher of the actual baseline (at initial scroll position) and the margin-box bottom.

  : [[https://www.w3.org/blog/CSS/2015/04/09/minutes-telecon-243/|ACTION: TabAtkins and fantasai to update Box Alignment spec per resolution, propose wording for CSS2.1 errata <trackbot> Created ACTION-678.]]

  ; Containment
  : [[https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2016Mar/0039.html|Resolved: Accept #3 from the e-mail (Overflow is allowed visually, but it doesn’t project its “geometry” past the layout-contained ancestor, so it can’t trigger overflow past a layout-containment boundary) and say hit testing is currently undefined.]]
  : [[https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2016Mar/0039.html|Resolved: Mark the undefined hit testing as an issue.]]

  ; CSS2.1
  : [[https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2015Sep/0252.html|Resolved: Moving a float to the next fragmentainer does not move in-flow content that comes after the float. (However, per CSS2.1, subsequent floats do move down.)]]

  : [[https://www.w3.org/blog/CSS/2015/06/22/minutes-new-york-f2f-2015-05-20-iii/|Resolved: accept "font-display-thing-whatever-loading" property with four values to be renamed later:]] "block | swap | fallback | optional." i.block shows blank, swaps in fallback at 3s, swaps in real font whenever it loads. ii. swap shows fallback, swaps in real font whenever it loads. iii. fallback shows fallback, swaps in real font if it loads before 3s. iv. optional shows real font if it loads from cache (very short timeout), otherwise shows fallback; optional allows UA to not continue loading the font for the next time.

It is suggested that this floor be ”1px” or less.”]]

  ; Input Modality

  : [[https://www.w3.org/blog/CSS/2015/06/25/minutes-telecon-251/|Resolved: Accept TabAtkins proposal for removing ambiguity from Resolution Media Query (thread with proposal)]]

  ; Misc
  : TabAtkins brought his proposal to address the possibility of font name being duplicated inside and outside a shadow DOM. The proposal would create a mapping where the external font is translated into a guaranteed unique name when passed into the shadow DOM. dbaron raised the possibility of instead using a function that gets the name from the scope, which was a cleaner solution. TabAtkins will write-up a new proposal using functions and send it to the mailing list for review.
