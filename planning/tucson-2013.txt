===== Lodging =====

Doubletree Reid Park Tucson. Rate - 179.00 p/night. Link and toll-free reservation number will be available soon. 


===== Transport to/from Airport =====

Volunteer Van - we will have a 8-12 seat shuttle van with volunteer drivers from the community. If you would like an airport pick-up, this can be arranged. Please add pick up requests to your note section in the participation section of this document.

Shuttles and Taxis - both a shared-ride shuttle and Taxis are available at the airport. With advanced notice, the Doubletree also offers pickup at no additional cost (please tip your driver, however)

Be advised Tucson is very spread out and public transportation is really limited. Shared rental cars might well be in order for some.

===== Transport to/from Meeting and Evening Event Locations =====

Volunteer van - we will run a volunteer van each evening of the event. 

If you want to explore on your own, a rental car or taxi is best.

If you are an avid cyclist, renting a bike might be a good choice. The hotel is directly across from a beautiful park, and if you don't mind biking a few miles, you can bike to and from the University. The main issue with that is while we have good bicycle lanes, you're in traffic the majority of the ride. 

I'll post specific vendors for these resources as they are available.
