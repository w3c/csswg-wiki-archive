====== Tucson F2F 2013 ======

**When**: February 4-6 (PROPOSED) 2013

**Where**: Tucson, Arizona USA - Locations under discussion - Hotel Congress (Funky Tucson Downtown Charm); The Biosphere (It's set up as a conference center with casitas now, so we'd do this on-location. It's a bit north of Tucson but could be really awesome to have our meeting there: Please see http://www.b2science.org/ and http://www.b2science.org/confcenter for details; Other Alternatives available but these two look especially good, and the Biosphere would get us all some press. UofA would take care of the room and food service, but of course lodging will have to be covered by members. I'll have more information soon.

**Host**: Molly E. Holzschlag | City of Tucson | University of Arizona | Add'l Sponsors TBD
