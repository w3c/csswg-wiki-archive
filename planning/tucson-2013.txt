====== Tucson F2F 2013 ======

**When**: February 4-6 (PROPOSED) 2013

**Where**: Tucson, Arizona USA - Locations under discussion 

  * Hotel Congress (Funky Tucson Downtown Charm) 
  * Biosphere 2 - Has a conference center with casitas now, so we'd do this all on-location in Catalina/Oro Valley. It's a bit north of Tucson but could be really awesome to have our meeting there: Please see http://www.b2science.org/ and http://www.b2science.org/confcenter for details 
  * On-Site University of Arizona - Two current options under examination: Meetings could take place in Gould-Simpson Building, http://www.arizona.edu/buildings/gould-simpson or the awesome Keating Building, http://www.bio5.org/about-bio5/thomas-w-keating-bioresearch-building
  * Other options include co-location spaces

With Biosphere2, University of Arizona would sponsor the meeting room and daily food service, but of course lodging will have to be covered by members. It's really affordable, around 80 a night per person/room in the casitas, which look well-appointed with full kitchens and common areas. 

With a University on-site lodging will likely be at the University Marriott or possibly the Arizona Inn. It just depends what kind of deals we can get.
