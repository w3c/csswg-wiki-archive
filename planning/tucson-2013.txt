====== Tucson F2F 2013 ======

**When**: February 4-6 (PROPOSED) 2013

**Where**: Tucson, Arizona USA - Locations under discussion 

 * Hotel Congress (Funky Tucson Downtown Charm) 
 * Biosphere 2 - this is the one my heart's set on. It's set up as a conference center with casitas now, so we'd do this all on-location in Catalina/Oro Valley. It's a bit north of Tucson but could be really awesome to have our meeting there: Please see http://www.b2science.org/ and http://www.b2science.org/confcenter for details 
 * Other Alternatives - I have a few tricks still available but I'm pretty hot for the biosphere idea.

UofA would take care of the room and food service, but of course lodging will have to be covered by members. It's really affordable, around 80 a night per person/room in the Casitas, which look well-appointed with full kitchens and common areas. I'll have more information soon.
