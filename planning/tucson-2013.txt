===== Dining and Events =====

** Evening Meals **
All meals are "Buy Your Own" unless otherwise noted.

  * Sunday: We have reservations from 7:30 at Old Pueblo Grille [[http://www.metrorestaurants.com/restaurants/opg.asp]] for anyone who wants to join. It's near the hotel, and has a fabulous historic atmosphere and great outdoor areas too. If you get in later than 7:30 pm not to worry, we're close to the airport too. Just text me.
  * Monday: Main Gate Restaurant/Cafe' Run - there are a ton of lovely restaurants and cafe's at the University main gate, walking distance from the meeting rooms. We can gather in groups and determine where to go. We will send at least one car back to the hotel and then down to the main area for folks who want to stay in or quickly drop things off.
  * Tuesday: Meeting wraps at 5pm for the Meetup. Folks can grab a bite before, return to the hotel if not participating, or come on down to the meetup where we'll have beer, wine and nibbles freely available. We'll be a hop and a skip from lots more fun and funky restaurants, bars and cafe's for those wishing to eat a full meal before or after.
  * Wednesday: Normally we'd have a banquet, but it appears people are leaving and/or working on Wednesday night. I propose a small gathering at my place for those who wish to eat and socialize. Depending upon interest, this will be catered as I'm too busy to cook for all y'all. This time.
  * Thursday: For those still around, we can meet up for a casual breakfast or anything you like. I recommend we take a drive through the Saguaro National Monument for a look at some of the area's wildlife. 

I promise once again not to make Bert ride a horse. 


** Tuesday Meetup **

Please see [[http://csswgtucson.eventbrite.com/]] for community meetup location and times.


===== Transport to/from Airport =====

Volunteer Van - NOTE - because so many folks are bringing/renting cars, the van will not be available. However, we will have volunteer drivers and I will have a car as well. If you want a known face to meet you upon arrival, make sure you've added that to your notes. Otherwise, taxis and shared-ride shuttles are available (15.00 - 20.00) from the airport. With advanced notice, the Doubletree also offers pickup for free (please tip your driver, however)

Be advised Tucson is very spread out and public transportation is really limited. 

===== Transport to/from Meeting and Evening Event Locations =====

Cars - cars will run each morning and evening of the event. On meeting days, please meet in the hotel lobby at 08:00 a.m.

If you want to explore on your own, a rental car or taxi is best.
