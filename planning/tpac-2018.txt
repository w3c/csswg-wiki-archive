==== Proposed Agenda ====

  * Environment Variables spec
  * Initial Letter Layout Model and other CSS Inline Layout Issues
  * [[https://wicg.github.io/construct-stylesheets/index.html|Constructable Stylesheets]]
  * Scrollbar Styling - FPWD, experimental implementation(s), and maybe even demo(s)?
  * [[https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/3118|text-underline-offset]]
  * [[https://drafts.csswg.org/css-text-4/#text-spacing-property|text-spacing]]
  * [[https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/1744|Propose adding lang as a font-face descriptor]] ideally with I18n Core 
  * Should we define outline more tightly and aim for close interop, or leave it open to UI innovation? (see [[https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/3184|3184]] for a recent example, but also the spec is full of "may")
