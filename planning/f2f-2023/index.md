# F2F Options

We're considering three different types of venues for the CSSWG F2F, which would be one of the **last two weeks in July** (likely 17th, to accommodate fremy, if no one else has stronger constraints).

**UPDATE**: The F2F will finally happen in Cupertino: <https://wiki.csswg.org/planning/cupertino-2023>

## Option 1: West Coast Corporate

- Likely venue: a conference room in the Apple offices in Cupertino or San Diego.
- Ventilation will likely be standard office ventilation without operable windows.
- Dial-in for Europe will be during night hours (6pm to 2am Central European)
- Nearby hotels are not cheap, and will definitely need a car to get around.
- No off-hours hangout space.

## Option 2: Mid-Atlantic East Coast

- Possible venues: [Rockwood Carriage House](https://www.rockwoodcarriagehouse.com/) in Wilmington, DE or [Princeton University Campus Club](https://www.nallsarch.com/projects/higher-education/campus-club-princeton/) in Princeton, NJ
- These venues have lots of operable windows.
- Full workday has reasonable dial-in overlap with Europe.
- Nearby hotels are not cheap, and will definitely need a car to get to them; but downtown Wilmington or Princeton is walkable.
- Might be able to arrange off-hours hangout space on site.

## Option 3: Cancun AirBnB

- Venue option: [Waterfront Villa](https://www.airbnb.com/luxury/listing/41774579)
- This venue completely opens up to the outside.
- Full workday has reasonable dial-in overlap with Europe.
- Venue includes on-site lodging and catering, and there are nearby lodging options that are also not too expensive; no need for a car.
- Lots of opportunities for off-hours discussions.

Note: Wrt expensing, we can invoice companies in whatever breakdown of lodging/food/event-ticket cost seems easiest to approve.

## Additional Notes

- Option 1 is the easiest to organize.
- Option 2’s Princeton variant has the best ice cream.
- Option 3’s “all inclusive” aspect allows a variety of options for load-balancing costs depending on each person's available travel funding.
