**When:** Wednesday 9 May – Friday 11 May

===== Agenda =====

==== Proposed Topics ====

  * fantasai's Box Alignment proposal

  * Grid Template level 4 - region-based styling, chaining regions, grid templates for paged media... (This should maybe be a subtopic of a larger topic about advanced layout, page templates, learning from XSL, needs of the publishing industry, etc., with help from Liam.)

WARNING: There will be a detour because of the Port Anniversary (see above) so maybe the prices for the taxi drive are going a bit up!

  * Public transport

The S-Bahn runs every 10 minutes from the airport of Hamburg to the city centre ( called: Hauptbahnhof ) in just 25 minutes.
