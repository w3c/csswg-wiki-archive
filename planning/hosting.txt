====== How to host a CSS Working Group meeting ======

(See also the general [[http://www.w3.org/Guide/hosting.htm|"Hosting W3C Face to Face Meetings."]])

To host a CSS meeting, you MUST provide:
  * A meeting room where the group can meet, without needing to sign any NDA or other agreement.
  * Chairs for people to sit in and tables for them to put their laptops at (which SHOULD be arranged in a U shape) such that the participants can easily hear each other speak
  * electricity for everybody's laptops (probably assume greater than 1 device per person average)
  * network connectivity that allows at least access to Web, IRC, and email, and preferably also skype/VoIP
  * A projection screen easily visible from all the chairs, and preferably to which anyone in any of the chairs can project from their seats
  * Either a whiteboard or flipchart that people can draw on, also visible from all the seats.
  * Telephone access, preferably a multi-microphone conference phone (is this a MUST or a SHOULD?)

All of the above should be ready to go by 9am on each meeting day.

You also SHOULD provide:
  * food and drinks for during the meeting (or have them otherwise reasonably available):  mid-morning coffee break, lunch, mid-afternoon break, and MAY also have breakfast available.  (More details here.)
