## Hosted Dinner

The hosted dinner is on Thursday night at [Hassan](http://bento.com/rev/1604.html), a shabu-shabu restaurant in Roppongi. [Location](https://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.662412,139.731322)

## Lodging

There are a number of hotels close to [Roppongi Hills](http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3031_hills.html). The [B Roppongi](http://www.theb-hotels.com/the-b-roppongi/en/#) is relatively new and reasonably priced. [Apartment rental](https://www.roomorama.com/short-term-rentals/tokyo/roppongi) is also an [option](https://www.airbnb.com/s/Roppongi--Minato--Tokyo--Japan?checkin=06%2F04%2F2013&checkout=06%2F08%2F2013) in the area. For something more traditional, [Andon Ryokan](http://www.andon.co.jp/) looks interesting but it's farther away via the subway. For something a tad more eccentric, try [here](http://www.timeout.jp/en/tokyo/feature/6424/Love-hotel-luxury-in-Kawasaki).

## Transport to/from Airport

Tokyo has two airports at which international flights land. A sprinkling of flights land at Haneda, which is located very close to the city center, but most flights land at Narita, an hour outside of Tokyo.

For flights arriving at Narita, the [Narita Express](http://www.jreast.co.jp/e/nex/index.html) train connects to the Yamanote line, the central ring line. Transfer at Shinagawa to the Yamanote Line, then switch to the Hibiya Line at [Ebisu](http://www.jreast.co.jp/e/stations/e290.html) to get to Roppongi. For flights arriving at Haneda, take the 50-year old [Haneda Monorail](http://www.tokyo-monorail.co.jp/english/) line to Hammamatsu-cho and transfer to the Yamanote Line heading to Shinagawa, then switch to the Hibiya Line at Ebisu. Since the Yamanote Line is a ring line, if you fall asleep and miss Ebisu you can continue your nap and get off the next time the train makes it way around to Ebisu. Or you can get off in Akihabara and experience the [interesting cultural attractions](http://travel.cnn.com/tokyo/drink/tokyos-best-maid-cafes-798315).

**Transit cards:** For getting to/from an airport and getting around town, using an IC transit card can make things really easy. These are stored value cards sold under the name SUICA (JR) or PASMO (Tokyo Metro) and are effectively the same. One adds value to the card and the transit fare is automatically deducted when exiting any JR train, private rail, subway or bus within the Tokyo area. When arriving at Narita, the [Suica and Narita Express package](http://www.jreast.co.jp/e/nex/suica_nex.html) is a good deal.

**Limo Bus**: A Limo bus will take you from Narita Terminal 1 or 2 directly to the Grand Hyatt in Roppongi, just across the street from the building where Google is located, and a short distance from the b Roppongi and other hotels. One way ticket is 3000¥, available at the Airport Limousine counter in both terminals. The Bus Stops are \#11 at Terminal 1 and \#6 at Terminal 2. See [Narita to Grand Hyatt Tokyo](http://www.limousinebus.co.jp/en/platform_searches/index/2/59) for details.
