====== Tokyo Workshop or Forum 2011 ======

  * See [[http://www.w3.org/Style/Japan-2011/]] for more up-to-date information.

===== Goal =====
The goal of this forum is providing an opportunity to CSS community people and let them directly talk with the CSS WG participants so that both the group participants and community people can have better mutual understanding and greater interest in each other's work.
Also we would like to see what kind of organization and/or mechanism would be suitable for improving the existing CSS specifications for Asian layout.

===== Scope / Audience =====
==== Expected Participants ====
  - CSS-WG participants
  - Stakeholders from related industries, e.g.:
  * Publishing or printing companies that own or seek solution for Asian text layout
  * Software vendors or open source projects that offer Asian text layout capability, e.g., Web browser vendors
  * Contents authors of Web pages and electronic books

Stakeholders from Asian countries who work for actual products are expected to participate in the forum.

===== Topics =====
Possible agenda topics include, but are not limited to the following:
  - Spec review of CSS3 specifications which is related to Asian layout capability, e.g., Writing Modes and Text
  - Presentations by Asin layout implementers and device vendors
  - Presentations by contents authors, e.g., Web pages, publishing, printing, digital signage
  - Panel discussions by all the key stakeholders

Note: The requirements and opinions of the CSS WG should be considered.

the candidate so far.
