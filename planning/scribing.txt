====== Scribing For Meetings ======

Minutes must be taken for every CSS Working Group call. At the beginning of each call, the chair chooses a scribe.

===== How To Scribe On IRC =====

<note tip>See the [[https://www.w3.org/wiki/IRC|IRC page on the W3C Wiki]] to find out how to join IRC. The CSSWG meet in the channel ''#css''.</note>

Whether you're scribing or not, use this command first to declare you are present:

  present+

Before you can scribe, you need to declare it. If you are the main scribe for the meeting, use this command:

  ScribeNick: your_irc_nickname_here

If you are an additional scribe, use this command:

  Scribe+ your_irc_nickname_here

Once the meeting starts, each discussion needs to go in a topic. When about to discuss a topic that is //not// on GitHub, use this command. You can get the topic name from the agenda.

  Topic: Topic name here

Most topics will relate to a GitHub issue. When about to discuss a GitHub issue, use this command. You can copy the issue URL from the agenda.

  github-bot, take up https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/123456

Starting a new topic also ends the previous topic. When you end a GitHub topic, the minutes automatically get posted by the GitHub bot to a comment in the issue.

Once you've set the topic, people can start discussing it. To record what people are saying, use their IRC nickname like so. You don't need to write every word; just a summary of what they are saying.

  SomeonesName: i propose we change the initial value of box-sizing to border-box
  SomeonesName: it would make more sense than content-box
  SomeoneElse: no, that would break web compat

If it's easier for you, you can use ''...'' instead of repeating their IRC nickname.

  SomeonesName: i propose we change the initial value of box-sizing to border-box
  ... it would make more sense than content-box
  SomeoneElse: no, that would break web compat

<note important>It is everyone's responsibility to make sure the minutes get recorded. If you can't keep up with everyone who's talking, you should interrupt and ask people to: speak more slowly, repeat themselves or stop talking while you catch up. Don't feel embarrassed about interrupting; we expect you to do it!</note>

When everyone agrees a resolution on a topic, use this command to record it. The chair will normally say the resolution, so they will tell you how to phrase it. Make sure you record it accurately.

  RESOLVED: The resolution here

<note tip>If the resolution sounds complicated, it's OK to ask someone else to write the it for you.</note>

Once you finish discussing the last topic and the meeting is ending, use this command:

  github-bot, end topic
