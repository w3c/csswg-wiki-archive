===== Agenda =====

https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/projects/38
==== Goals ====

  * Reduce Agenda+ backlog:
    * [[https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Agenda%2B+F2F%22|Agenda+ F2F]]
    * [[https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AAgenda%2B|Agenda+]]
    * [[https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Agenda%2B+Later%22|Agenda+ Later]]
    * [[https://github.com/w3c/css-houdini-drafts/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Agenda%2B%22+|Houdini Agenda+]]
    * [[https://github.com/w3c/fxtf-drafts/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Agenda%2B%22+|FXTF Agenda+]]
  * Allow time and space for fuzzier open-ended discussions and breakouts
  * Post-pandemic repair of group communication and collaboration (particularly across company boundaries)

==== Possible breakout topics ====

  * Line-breaking and related features in [[https://www.w3.org/TR/css-text-4/|CSS Text Level 4]]
  * line-clamp, continue: discard, and friends (also listed as a main track topic, but a break-out might be useful for a deep-dive, before bringing back potential conclusions to the main track) (Andreu Botella would like to join remotely. Europe-friendly scheduling appreciated)
  * ??? Add Suggestions Here ???

==== Regular-track topics ====

In addition to [[https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Agenda%2B+F2F%22|Agenda+ F2F Issues]]...

  * Anchor Positioning
  * Masonry?
  * CSS Grid Layout L1 fixes (any output from Tab+Oriol+fantasai’s workday on Monday)
  * Line-clamp (Andreu Botella would like to join remotely. Europe-friendly scheduling appreciated)
  * styling of details elements (see [[https://github.com/dbaron/details-styling|somewhat draft-y document]]) (could be a lightning pitch, except I think a little discussion would be useful)
  * ??? Add topics you want to discuss / present here so the chairs can schedule them ???

==== Lightning Pitches ====

1min-5min informal pitches to ask for CSSWG’s attention / help on particular issues, concerns, or feature requests that aren't ready for formal discussion, see [[https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-css-wg/2023JulSep/0031.html|Lightning Pitches Description]]. Register your name and/or topics below if you want the wiki to help you remember.

  * Yehonatan Daniv: animation-trigger, [[https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/8942|issue]]

  * Christopher Cameron: Dynamic range limit for HDR content [[https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/9074|issue]], [[https://github.com/ccameron-chromium/hdr-headroom-limit/blob/main/EXPLAINER.md|proposal]]
  * David Baron: focusability of `display: contents`; see [[https://github.com/mozilla/standards-positions/issues/772|mozilla/standards-positions#772]] and [[https://github.com/WebKit/standards-positions/issues/164|WebKit/standards-positions#164]]
