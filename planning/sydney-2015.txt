==== Hotels ====

Please note that I don't have any direct experience of these hotels! If you've stayed in one before (looking at you, Tab), chime in and recommend.

There are some close but expensive hotels:
  * [[http://www.1888hotel.com.au/|1888]] has a reputation as being a great boutique hotel. Rooms seem to be ~$240 per night for stays of 2 nights or more.
  * [[http://www.novoteldarlingharbour.com.au/|Novotel]] is a reasonable international hotel. Rooms are ~$280 per night.
  * [[http://www.ibis.com/gb/hotel-1757-ibis-sydney-darling-harbour/index.shtml|Ibis]] is also close by. 

There are also a number of decent cheaper hotels in China town. These are further away (~20 minute walk from the office).
  * [[http://www.metrohotels.com.au/hotels/new-south-wales/aspire-hotel-sydney/welcome/|Aspire]] is about $130 a night.
  * [[http://www.metrohotels.com.au/hotels/new-south-wales/metro-hotel-sydney-central/welcome/|Metro hotel]] is around $160 (more on the weekends).
  * [[http://www.rydges.com/accommodation/sydney-nsw/capitol-square-sydney/welcome/|Capitol Square Rydges]] is also about $160.

I had a reasonable amount of success looking for cheaper rates (in many cases at these same hotels) on booking.com. 


Anyone organizing an airbnb?

The GoogleGuest network will be available throughout the building. No password is required.

=== Money ===

Its plastic. No, not that sort of plastic. Being able to swim and paper money are fundamentally incompatible. Side note: **do not iron the money**

More seriously, it's the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_dollar|Australian dollar (AUD)]].  See [[http://www.oanda.com/currency/table?exch=AUD&sel_list=USD_EUR_GBP_JPY_NOK_SEK_NZD_CNY_TWD_KRW&value=1&format=HTML&redirected=1|exchange rates]].

=== Electricity ===

230V, 50Hz, 10A [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AS/NZS_3112|flat, angled awesome pins]]

Via the [[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKUZhoYJI3M|magic of pliers]], Australian and US power plugs are somewhat interoperable (I don't recommend you actually do this).
=== Tourism ===

Far too many tourists, especially in winter^H^H^H^H^H^Hsummer
