====== Paris F2F 2013 ======

**Dates**: 2013 September 11-13

**Location**: Mozilla Paris, 16bis blvd. Montmartre, Paris 75009, France.  Room 123, Salle Des Fêtes

From the metro, use either:
  * **Grands Boulevards**:  Follow the signs to exit 2 (boulevard Montmartre).  After you reach the top of the stairs, continue straight ahead until you reach a large doorway with the number 16<sup>__BIS__</sup> over it, just after the Pret a Manger.
  * **Richelieu-Drouot**:  This station does not have numbered exits.  Follow the signs for exits (signs with "SORTIE", with white letters on a blue background) to the exit for "RUE DROUOT".  At the top of these stairs, continue straight ahead and immediately cross Rue Drouot (the smaller of the two streets at the intersection), and continue straight ahead until you find a large doorway with the number 16<sup>__BIS__</sup> over it, just before the Pret a Manger.

Once you're at this large door, you'll need to go through ''three'' doors to enter the Mozilla space:
  * First, the large door to the street with the number 16<sup>__BIS__</sup> over it.  It has a keypad to the right of it.  On this keypad you can use the arrows to select "MOZILLA" and then press the button with a bell symbol to call to be let in.  Once you are let in, you need to push on the ''left'' half of the door.  Push on the bar rather than the doorway, since there is a smaller door (hard to see) that does not take up the full doorway.  (Note that both halves of the door have a bar to push on, but you need to push on the bar on the left half.)  This door is **quite heavy**, and you will have to push **hard**.
  * Second, you need to cross a metal gate just inside this doorway.  Follow exactly the same procedure on the freestanding keypad before the gate.  Then pull on the right half of the gate to enter.
  * Then, walk forward about 10 meters, and on your right you will see a doorway with the word "Mozilla" on the glass.  This door has a simple doorbell button on it you can use to be let in.  On this door, pull on the left half of the door (which is the only half with a handle).

Then walk up the stairs into the Mozilla space.  Turn right past the reception desk, and you will reach the Salle Des Fêtes.
