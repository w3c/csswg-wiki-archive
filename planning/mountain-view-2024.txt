===== Social activities =====

   * If others are interested, dbaron can probably plan a birdwatching walk in the morning one day before the meeting starts.  We're very near one of the best winter birdwatching spots in western North America.  We can probably walk from [[https://maps.app.goo.gl/dfRUDbbSGYad7BCG6|the end of San Antonio Road]], assuming we have transportation to get there and back easily (meaning faster than the 20 minute walk between GWC5 and the trailhead, which would probably require too early a start to get back in time for the meeting).
