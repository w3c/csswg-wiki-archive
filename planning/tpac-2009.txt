====== TPAC 2009 ======

Fill in proposed agenda topics below:


  * possibility of text-overflow overhaul
  * modularization and how to write a profile/snapshot. E.g., how to update what <color> means in css3-multicol after css3-color becomes REC. (See 14 Oct telcon.) Or can modules never be published out of order?
