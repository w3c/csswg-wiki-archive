====== TPAC 2009 ======

Informal gathering of present and past CSS WG Members

  * Lobby of Hotel Mariott Santa Clara (2700 Mission College Boulevard Santa Clara, CA 95054) at 7pm. Warning, the CSS WG does not pay for you.

Fill in proposed agenda topics below:


  * possibility of text-overflow overhaul
  * modularization and how to write a profile/snapshot. E.g., how to update what <color> means in css3-multicol after css3-color becomes REC. (See 14 Oct telcon.) Or can modules never be published out of order?
  * fitting text size so that text fills a given width. Is this part of 'text-align-last' or separate? Who can edit the Text module if we want to include this feature? (Oct 14 telcon)
  * consistency between layout modules (Table, Template, Grid, Flexbox).  It would be great to unify the ideas present in these, or at least define some primitives they can share.
  * **Invite SVG to discussion:** [[http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-grid/overview.html|css3-grid,]] [[http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-flexbox/|css3-flexbox,]] and [[http://www.w3.org/Style/Group/css3-src/css3-layout/Overview.html|css3-layout]] (needs of GUIs? needs of typography? merge into one module?)
  * Review Selectors implementation reports - Move directly to PR?
  * Targeting filters
  * run-in definitions, see [[http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2009Sep/0126.html|the five issues]]
