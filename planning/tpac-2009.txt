===== Proposed Topics =====

Fill in proposed agenda topics below:


  * possibility of text-overflow overhaul
  * modularization and how to write a profile/snapshot. E.g., how to update what <color> means in css3-multicol after css3-color becomes REC. (See 14 Oct telcon.) Or can modules never be published out of order?
  * fitting text size so that text fills a given width. Is this part of 'text-align-last' or separate? Who can edit the Text module if we want to include this feature? (Oct 14 telcon)
  * consistency between layout modules (Table, Template, Grid, Flexbox).  It would be great to unify the ideas present in these, or at least define some primitives they can share.
  * **Invite SVG to discussion:** [[http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-grid/overview.html|css3-grid,]] [[http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-flexbox/|css3-flexbox,]] and [[http://www.w3.org/Style/Group/css3-src/css3-layout/Overview.html|css3-layout]] (needs of GUIs? needs of typography? merge into one module?)
  * Review Selectors implementation reports - Move directly to PR?
  * Targeting filters
  * run-in definitions, see [[http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2009Sep/0126.html|the five issues]]
  * 2010 F2F dates
  * Drop shadow proposal
  * Discuss font feature support
  * css3-2d-transforms issues
  * css3-transitions issues
  * collect last-call comments on [[http://www.w3.org/TR/2009/WD-mathml-for-css-20091006/|MathML-for-CSS.]] Probably needs only 10 minutes: explain the draft (Bert) and collect comments, of which there are probably none.
  * advance [[http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-multicol/|multicol spec]] to CR. [[http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-multicol/last-call.html|Last call comments]] have been collected and responded to.


===== Informal gathering of present and past CSS WG Members =====

  * Lobby of Hotel Mariott Santa Clara (2700 Mission College Boulevard Santa Clara, CA 95054) at 7pm on Sunday. Warning, the CSS WG does not pay for you.
