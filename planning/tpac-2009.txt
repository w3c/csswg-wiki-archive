====== TPAC 2009 ======

Fill in proposed agenda topics below:


  * possibility of text-overflow overhaul
  * modularization and how to write a profile/snapshot. E.g., how to update what <color> means in css3-multicol after css3-color becomes REC. (See 14 Oct telcon.) Or can modules never be published out of order?
  * fitting text size so that text fills a given width. Is this part of 'text-align-last' or separate? Who can edit the Text module if we want to include this feature? (Oct 14 telcon)
  * consistency between layout modules (Table, Template, Grid, Flexbox).  It would be great to unify the ideas present in these, or at least define some primitives they can share.
  * Invite SVG to discussion: css3-grid, css3-flexbox and css3-layout (needs of GUIs? needs of typography? merge into one module?)
