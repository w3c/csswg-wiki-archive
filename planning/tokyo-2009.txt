     issue about margin collapsing and page breaks:

       http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2009Jan/0286.html
       http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2009Feb/0562.html
       http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2009Jan/0341.html

     people may want to think about more use cases

 - css3-multicol -- is it ready for last call? we should discuss column-break 
   properties on a white-board, though

 - css3-values -- the interface with css3-syntax may need some tuning:

 - css3-gcpm -- there are two implementations of a significant subset
   of the functionality, and howcome suggests making a new draft based on 

      http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-gcpm/

   sans sections: 8, 9, 17, 20-25

   this avoids the difficult "how-to-move-elements" issue, the
   experimentional "paged-presentations-for-all" and the more advanced
   layout and semi-transformation stuff.
