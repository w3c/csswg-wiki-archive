#### Visa Requirements

A visa is required for US Citizens to enter Australia (citizens of other countries please check with the appropriate authorities), a visa may be obtained electronically from the [Electronic Travel Authority web site](http://www.eta.immi.gov.au/).

### Travel to/from airport

A taxi from the airport to the meeting venue or any of the listed hotels will cost between \$30 and \$50, depending on traffic. There's generally only a short wait to get a taxi, and a fairly orderly queue. This is probably the most convenient, and also the cheapest if you share with others…

If staying in Chinatown, the [airport train line](http://www.airportlink.com.au/directions/sydney-city.php) is reasonably convenient. A one-way ticket is \$16.40. If you're staying in Pyrmont, you can still take the train, then jump on the [light rail](http://www.sydneylightrail.transport.nsw.gov.au/) from 'Central' to 'the Star'. You'll need to pay \$4.60 (in cash) after boarding the train.

Some hotels offer complimentary bus transfers to/from the airport - check with your hotel when booking.

### Hotels

Please note that I don't have any direct experience of these hotels! If you've stayed in one before (looking at you, Tab), chime in and recommend.

There are some close but expensive hotels:

- [1888](http://www.1888hotel.com.au/) has a reputation as being a great boutique hotel. Rooms seem to be ~\$240 per night for stays of 2 nights or more.
- [Novotel](http://www.novoteldarlingharbour.com.au/) is a reasonable international hotel. Rooms are ~\$280 per night.
- [Ibis](http://www.ibis.com/gb/hotel-1757-ibis-sydney-darling-harbour/index.shtml) is also close by.

There are also a number of decent cheaper hotels in China town. These are further away (~20 minute walk from the office) - note that there is a light rail line from this area to the office. Services depart every 10 minutes during peak and a return ticket (which can be purchased on the train) is \$6.40.

- [Aspire](http://www.metrohotels.com.au/hotels/new-south-wales/aspire-hotel-sydney/welcome/) is about \$130 a night.
- [Metro hotel](http://www.metrohotels.com.au/hotels/new-south-wales/metro-hotel-sydney-central/welcome/) is around \$160 (more on the weekends).
- [Capitol Square Rydges](http://www.rydges.com/accommodation/sydney-nsw/capitol-square-sydney/welcome/) is also about \$160.

I had a reasonable amount of success looking for cheaper rates (in many cases at these same hotels) on booking.com.

### Airbnb

- Tab [just booked one](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/5023154?euid=a959e31e-64af-6dd8-7d21-ae0323570d39),

It can host 6 people, and 6 people have expressed interest.

- Tab Atkins: Feb 4 to 13 (I'm here longer than all of y'all)
- Tantek Çelik Feb 8 to 12 (departing that day)
- Rossen Atanassov: Feb 6 to 12
- Dave Cramer: Feb 7 to 12
- Florian Rivoal: Feb 8 to 12
- Fantasai

### Other

#### Network

The GoogleGuest network will be available throughout the building. No password is required.

#### Money

Its plastic. No, not that sort of plastic. Being able to swim and paper money are fundamentally incompatible. Side note: **do not iron the money**

More seriously, it's the [Australian dollar (AUD)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_dollar). See [exchange rates](http://www.oanda.com/currency/table?exch=AUD&sel_list=USD_EUR_GBP_JPY_NOK_SEK_NZD_CNY_TWD_KRW&value=1&format=HTML&redirected=1).

You should be able to use your credit card pretty much everywhere (especially Mastercard and Visa). Diners Club cards tend to attract a fee or not be accepted. Checks are not generally accepted.

#### Electricity

230V, 50Hz, 10A [flat, angled awesome pins](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AS/NZS_3112)

Notice the small switch on the side. Unless you flip it on, don't expect the power socket to do much for you.

Via the [magic of pliers](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKUZhoYJI3M), Australian and US power plugs are somewhat interoperable (I don't recommend you actually do this).

#### Tourism

Far too many tourists, especially in winter^H^H^H^H^H^Hsummer

### Food

We have both kinds: pies and ..

actually, just [pies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meat_pie_%28Australia_and_New_Zealand%29).
