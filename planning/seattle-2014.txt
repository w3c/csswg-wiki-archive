   * The [[http://www.soundtransit.org/Schedules/Central-Link-light-rail?tab=Map|Link Light Rail]] departs every 7.5 to 15 minutes depending on the time of day. The trip takes about 40mn end to end; the fare is $2.75 one way.

===== Housing =====

   * Nearest hotels
      * [[http://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/seacd-courtyard-seattle-downtown-lake-union/|Courtyard Seattle Downtown Lake Union]]
         * Same hotel we held the 2011 meeting at. ~2 miles from Adobe office.
   * Downtown hotels
      * NOTE: I am currently looking into getting a group quote from the Andra and/or the Fairmont.

      * [[http://www.fairmont.com/seattle/|Fairmont Seattle]] 
      * [[http://www.hotelmaxseattle.com/|Hotel Max]]
      * [[http://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/seawf-seattle-marriott-waterfront/|Seattle Marriott Waterfront]]
   * Capitol Hill hotels
      * Though farther than downtown, Cap Hill is the fun and hip area of Seattle. Very walkable and a lot of restaurants, bars etc. Highly recommended if you're going to spend a little extra time here but it will be more work to reach the meeting venue from here (while the inns below are not much farther from Adobe than the downtown waterfront, there is a lake in the way...)
      * [[http://www.gaslight-inn.com/|Gaslight Inn]]  
      * [[http://www.11thavenueinn.com/|11th Avenue Inn]]
   * AirBnb
      * Though Seattle is not as clustered with Airbnb options as other cities, it is catching up.
      * The Fremont and Wallingford neighborhoods guarantee you walking distance to the meeting. The Eastlake neighborhood is bikable but remember: late January implies some rain.
      * [[https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/1844791?guests=5&s=1005|A 3BR house in the same neighborhood as Adobe, ~12-15mn walk; no reviews yet but this would be my favorite to rent around here]]
      * [[https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/1472532?guests=3&s=3155|Downtown 1 BR apartment]]  
      * [[https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/59838?guests=2&s=a14d|Downtown 2BR close to buses]]

===== Travel to/from Adobe =====

   * At 3.8 miles the waterfront Marriott is the furthest from the office. 
   * A number of buses - 26, 28, 40 - can be taken from 3rd & Virginia downtown to Fremont. Ride time ~20-30mn depending on traffic. One-way ride fare is $2.50. 
   * Uber/UberX, Lyft and car2go are also available in Seattle.
