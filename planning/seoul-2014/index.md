## Housing

We have negotiated hotel rooms at reduced price at Hotel Gallery, 150 meters away from the meeting venue.The Hotel Gallery is the only luxury business hotel in Seongnam-City, Seoul’s largest commuting satellite city. It is located in the central downtown of Bundang-gu which is the most thriving area of Seongnam City. The area can be connected in 30 minutes from big cities around Seoul, such as Suwon and Anyang.

**We recommend you book your hotel room as soon as possible because we won't be able to keep these rooms for very long.** Reservation **must** be done using [this form (docx format)](/_media/planning/seoul2014-hotel-reservation-form.docx). It can be sent by email or fax. Please ping Daniel if you have any issue with the hotel using this form.

Warning: the limousine bus mentioned on the reservation form is for people landing in Seohyeon Domestic Airport. If you arrive from abroad, you'll land in Incheon International Airport or Gimpo International Airport…

  - Taxi is always available from the Incheon International Airport, whose fare (one way) will be approximately KRW 120,000~140,000 for deluxe taxi and KRW 80,000~100,000 for normal taxi( tall gate fee will be added). Again, all taxis accept VISA for payment.
  - Taxi fare (one way) from the Gimpo International Airport will be approximately KRW 100,000 for deluxe taxi and KRW 60,000~80,000 for normal taxi (tall gate fee will be added).
