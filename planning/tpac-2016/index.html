==== Agenda ====

=== Monday ===

== AM ==

  * CSS Tables Level 3
        * Fixup rewrite (https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/466)
        * Fixup collapsible whitespace (https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/467)
        * What CSS is applicable to table-track & table-track-grouping elements (https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/469)
        * table-wrapper box and captions (https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/471)
        * track merging (https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/473)
        * percentage resolution (https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/474)
        * border-radius in collapsed mode (https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/475)
        * height on a table-row-group (https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/476)
        * min-height on a table-row (https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/477)
        * table-layout:fixed width distribution (https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/484)
        * visibility: collapse (https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/478)
  * [[https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/383|url() as image or SVG reference]]

== PM ==

  * Joint [[https://www.w3.org/dpub/IG/wiki/Detailed_TPAC_2016_Agenda#Meeting_with_CSS_WG|meeting with digipub]] (Monday 1pm)
  * Hanging Punctuation
  * Proposal for a new Regions specification — Jen Simmons, https://speakerdeck.com/jensimmons/proposal-to-csswg-sept-2016
  * HDR https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2016Sep/0047.html (Mark Watson)
  * Transforms L2: backport translate/rotate/scale, as they're stable but L1 still isn't?
  * CSS Variables: 
        * var() in @keyframes? Multiple engines already support.
        * Do "value tainting" of animation-tainted custom properties? (Rather than current "document-global name tainting")
        * How to store custom property values? Like strings (exactly preserved) or like token streams (may change from author phrasing)? "--path: m40.0,20.0" can reserialize as-is, or as "--path: m40/**/0.0,20.0".
  * Approval to implement and ship transitionstart/transitionrun/transitioncancel/animationcancel?
  * CSS Cascade: "revert" is very expensive; Safari has busted (cheap) implementation. Can we simplify?
  * CR plan for 2016 - which specs are 'close' to CR? what is left to get them there by December pub moratorium? (Tantek)
