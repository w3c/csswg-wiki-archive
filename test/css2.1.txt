====== CSS 2.1 Test Suite =======

The CSS2.1 Conformance Test Suite tests conformance to the [[http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/|CSS2.1 specification]]. It is currently in the earlier stages of development, and is very incomplete. Additionally, some tests may be invalid due to changes in the spec. The [[http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/CSS2.1/|latest version]] is available on the W3C website. The [[http://test.csswg.org/|source files]] are available on the repository website. [[http://hg.csswg.org/test|Anonymous read-only Mercurial access]] is available to this repository. Note that many of the tests rely on the [[http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/Fonts/Ahem/|Ahem font]].

Discussion about the CSS2.1 Test Suite takes place on the publicly-archived [[http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-css-testsuite/|public-css-testsuite@w3.org]] mailing list.

=== CSS 2.1 Test Suite v2.0 ===
Release Date: TBD

The CSS 2.1 Conformance Test Suite should be refreshed and be re-released to address all of the changes since the last official 1.0 release.  The criteria for releasing this new suite is to correct or fix all of the tests that are producing incorrect results in any way. These tests have been reviewed, are flagged with [NeedsWork=Precision] and/or [NeedsWork=Incorrect] in Shepherd. Additionally, before releasing the suite, the tests that have been flagged as Rejected should be revisited and Retracted accordingly.

Here are the current set of issues that need attention in order to fulfill the release criteria:

  * [[test:css2.1:incorrect|NeedsWork=Incorrect]]
  * [[test:css2.1:precision|NeedsWork=Precision]] 
  * [[test:css2.1:incorrect-precision|NeedsWork=Precision + NeedsWork=Incorrect]] 
  * [[test:css2.1:rejected|Rejected]]
  * [[test:css2.1:update-guidelines|Guidelines for updating tests]]
