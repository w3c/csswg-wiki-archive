===== Rendering page boxes that do not fit a page sheet =====
<markdown>
XXX If a page box does not match the target page sheet dimensions, the user agent must either render the page box at the indicated size on a larger page sheet; or rotate the page box 90° if this will make the page box fit the page sheet; or scale the page box to fit the page sheet; or reformat the page contents, including 'spilling' onto other page sheets; or clip overflowed content.
: <blockquote>If a page box does not match the target page sheet dimensions, the user agent  MAY  choose (in order of preference) to:
   1. Render the page box at the indicated size on a larger page sheet.
   2. Rotate the page box 90° if this will make the page box fit the page sheet.
   3. Scale the page box to fit the page sheet. (There is no requirement to maintain the aspect ratio of the page or of any elements on the page when scaling; however, preservation of the aspect ratio is preferred.)
   4. Reformat the page contents, including 'spilling' onto other page sheets.
   5. Clip overflowed content (least preferred).</blockquote>

===== Dimension of margin boxes =====

==== top row ====

<markdown>
The used values of the top-left, top-center, and top-right margin boxes' widths and left and right margins are chosen such that the sum of the squares of their left and right margins is minimized under the constraints below.
: <blockquote>
    <p>The following rules apply to 'top-left', 'top-center' and 'top-right' margin boxes, which are referred to as [1], [2], and [3], respectively, in the expression below.</p>
    <p>The UA chooses used values for each box's width, left and right margin, left and right border thickness, and left and right padding. It chooses them in such a way that the value of: left-margin[1]² + left-margin[2]² + left-margin[3]² + right-margin[1]² + 	right-margin[2]² + right-margin[3]² is as small as possible under the constraints below. ("foo[n]" stands for the used value of property foo of the n'th box and "x²" for the square of x.)</p>
  </blockquote>

The sum of the outer widths of the top-left, top-center, and top-right boxes is equal to the distance between the right page border edge and the right page border edge.
: <q>The sum of the outer widths of the three boxes is equal to max box width.</q>
  <q>max box width, which is the sum of the width of the page's left padding area, the width of the page area, and the width of the page's right padding area. In other words, it is the distance between the left page border and the right page border.</q>

If the top-center box is not empty or its computed width is not 'auto' then the outer widths of the top-left and top-right boxes are equal.
: <q>If the center box is not empty or if its computed width is not 'auto', then the outer widths of the other two boxes are equal to each other (i.e., the center box is centered in that case).</q>

XX If the top-left box is empty and its computed width is 'auto', then the used values of its left and right padding and left and right border width are all 0.
: <q>3. If a box is empty and its computed width is 'auto', then the used values of its left and right padding and left and right border are all 0.</q>

XX If the top-center box is empty and its computed width is 'auto', then the used values of its left and right padding and left and right border width are all 0.
: <q>3. If a box is empty and its computed width is 'auto', then the used values of its left and right padding and left and right border are all 0.</q>

XX If the top-right box is empty and its computed width is 'auto', then the used values of its left and right padding and left and right border width are all 0.
: <q>3. If a box is empty and its computed width is 'auto', then the used values of its left and right padding and left and right border are all 0.</q>

The used value of the top-left box's left margin is its computed value unless that value is 'auto'.

: <q>The used values of the left box's left margin, the center box's left and right margin and the right box's right margin are their respective computed values, unless that computed value is 'auto'.</q>

The used value of the top-left box's right margin is its computed value unless that value is 'auto' or unless honoring both this margin and the top-right box's computed left margin contradicts another constraint.
: <blockquote>
    <p>7. The used values of the left box's right margin and the right box's left margin are their respective computed values, unless that computed value is 'auto'.</p>
    <p>If the above constraints are contradictory ("over-constrained"), then constraint 7 is replaced by 7a:</p>
    <p>7a. If the computed values of the left box's left and right margins are 'auto and not 'auto', respectively, then the used value of the right margin is its computed value. If the computed values of the right box's left and right margins are not 'auto' and 'auto', respectively, then the used value of the left margin is its computed value. This effectively means that the specified right margin of the left box is ignored if necessary, and ditto for the left margin of the right box.</p>
  </blockquote>

The used value of the top-right box's left margin is its computed value unless that value is 'auto' or unless honoring both this margin and the top-left box's computed right margin contradicts another constraint.

The 'cover' value of the 'image-scaling' property does not affect the usual calculation of the used height and width except if both 'height' and 'width' are 'auto', and the used value of at least one of 'min-width' and 'min-height' is not '0', in which case the used width and used height of the element are calculated as though the intrinsic dimensions of the contents were infinitesimally small numbers whose ratio is the actual intrinsic ratio of the contents.
: <q>Determine the used 'height' and 'width' as usual, except if both 'height' and 'width' are 'auto', and the used value of at least one of 'min-width' and 'min-height' is not '0', then compute the used width and used height of the element as though the intrinsic dimensions of the contents were infinitesimally small numbers whose ratio is the actual intrinsic ratio of the contents.</q>

The 'cover' value of the 'image-scaling' property scales the contents of the element, preserving their aspect ratio, to the smallest size such that the width of the contents is greater than or equal to the used width of the box and the height of the contents is greater than or equal to the height of the box.
: <q>Scale the contents of the element, preserving their aspect ratio, to the smallest size such that the width of the contents is greater than or equal to the used width of the box and the height of the contents is greater than or equal to the height of the box.</q>

The 'overflow' property determines how to render parts of the replaced element's content that extend beyond the edges of its box.

The syntax of the 'image-position' property is [ [  <percentage> |  <length> | left | center | right ] [  <percentage> |  <length> | top | center | bottom ]? ] | [ [ left | center | right ] || [ top | center | bottom ] ] | auto.
: <q>Value: [ [  <percentage> |  <length> | left | center | right ] [  <percentage> |  <length> | top | center | bottom ]? ] | [ [ left | center | right ] || [ top | center | bottom ] ] | auto</q>

The initial value of the 'image-position' property is 50% 50%.
: <q>Initial: 50% 50%</q>

The 'image-position' property applies to replaced elements.
: <q>Applies to: replaced elements</q>

The 'image-position' property is inherited.
: <q>Inherited: yes</q>

The 'image-position' property applies to visual media.
: <q>Media: visual</q>

When two values are given for 'image-position' and at least one of them is not a keyword, the first value represents alignment in the horizontal dimension and the second represents alignment in the vertical.
: <q>See background-position  for a detailed description of values other than 'auto'.</q>

  <q>If two values are given, the horizontal position comes first. (CSS2.1:14.2.1)</q>

When a single value is given for 'image-position' and that value is not a keyword, that value represents alignment in the horizontal dimension and alignment in the vertical dimension is treated as 50%.
: <q>See background-position  for a detailed description of values other than 'auto'.</q>

  <q>If only one percentage or length value is given, it sets the horizontal position only, and the vertical position will be 50%. (CSS2.1:14.2.1)</q>

When the first value of 'image-position' is a percentage X, the point X% across the image from its left edge must be aligned with the point X% across the padding box of the element.
: <q>With a value pair of '0% 0%', the upper left corner of the image is aligned with the upper left corner of the box's padding edge. A value pair of '100% 100%' places the lower right corner of the image in the lower right corner of padding area. With a value pair of '14% 84%', the point 14% across and 84% down the image is to be placed at the point 14% across and 84% down the padding area.</q>

When the second value of 'image-position' is a percentage Y, the point Y% down the image from its top edge must be aligned with the point Y% down the padding box of the element.
: <q>With a value pair of '0% 0%', the upper left corner of the image is aligned with the upper left corner of the box's padding edge. A value pair of '100% 100%' places the lower right corner of the image in the lower right corner of padding area. With a value pair of '14% 84%', the point 14% across and 84% down the image is to be placed at the point 14% across and 84% down the padding area.</q>

When the first value of 'image-position' is a length L, the left edge of the image is placed L to the right of the left edge of the padding box of the element.
: <q>With a value pair of '2cm 2cm', the upper left corner of the image is placed 2cm to the right and 2cm below the upper left corner of the padding area.</q>

When the second value of 'image-position' is a length L, the top edge of the image is placed L below the top edge of the padding box of the element.
: <q>With a value pair of '2cm 2cm', the upper left corner of the image is placed 2cm to the right and 2cm below the upper left corner of the padding area.</q>

The 'top' value of 'image-position' is the same as 0% for the vertical alignment value.
: <q>'top left', 'left top': Same as '0% 0%'. 'top', 'top center', 'center top': Same as '50% 0%'. 'right top', 'top right':  Same as '100% 0%'.</q>

The 'left' value of 'image-position' is the same as 0% for the horizontal alignment value.
: <q>'top left', 'left top': Same as '0% 0%'. 'left', 'left center', 'center left': Same as '0% 50%'. 'bottom left', 'left bottom': Same as '0% 100%'.</q>

The 'center' value of 'image-position' is the same as 50% for either the horizontal alignment value (if it is not otherwise given) or the vertical alignment value (if it is not otherwise given).
: <q>'top', 'top center', 'center top': Same as '50% 0%'. 'left', 'left center', 'center left': Same as '0% 50%'. 'center', 'center center': Same as '50% 50%'. 'center', 'center center': Same as '50% 50%'. 'bottom', 'bottom center', 'center bottom': Same as '50% 100%'.</q>
