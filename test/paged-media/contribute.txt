====== Contributing to the CSS2.1 Test Suite ======

The CSS2.1 Test Suite still needs a lot of work, and the CSS Working Group can't finish it all by itself. Anyone can contribute: here are the guidelines.

  * All contributions are governed by the [[http://www.w3.org/|W3C]]'s [[http://www.w3.org/2004/10/27-testcases.html|Policies for Contribution of Test Cases]].
  * All tests must conform to the [[http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/guidelines.html|CSS2.1 Test Suite Guidelines]]

====== How to Contribute a New Test ======

===== Template for New Tests =====

The baseline format for CSS2.1 tests is XHTML 1.1. A set of scripts generate the various formats from this source version.

Copy and paste the following text into a new file, or save this file, and replace the capitalized parts. ''<link>'' elements are used to [[http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/guidelines.html#links|link to the relevant section of the spec]]. If this file tests one or more specific [[test:paged-media:assertions|test assertions]], add a ''<meta>'' element for each one, copying the assertion directly into its ''content'' attribute. A test will generally test many sections and assertions (e.g. every test tests for proper parsing): only list ones that the test focuses on: ones that must still be tested in this test even if the test's approach to testing them changes in the future.
