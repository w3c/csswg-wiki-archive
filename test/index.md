# Testing

Our conformance test suites: how to run them, known bugs, and how to contribute.

The tests are maintained in the [web-platform-tests](https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests) [Git](https://git-scm.com/) repository, mostly in the `css` subdirectory.

Test suite and test case discussion takes place primarily in [GitHub issues](https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests/issues), with policy matters occasionally discussed on the [public-test-infra mailing list](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-test-infra/). The [\#testing channel](../tools/irc/ "tools:irc") on irc.w3.org:6665 is also available for discussion, and is recommended for anything where a quick response is desirable. 

If this is your first time working with Web Platform Test, see this introduction and tutorial:
