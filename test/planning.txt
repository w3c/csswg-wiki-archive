====== Test Suite Project Planning ======

This is where fantasai dumps her to-do list and tries to make sense of it.

  * Set up test.csswg.org to give useful information on stuff in SVN
      * Set up Makefile on dev.w3.org to have option for importing tests from test.csswg.org [want]
      * Set up automatic build of all validating tests on test.csswg.org (tests not in format aren't built, but can be repo) [need]
      * Create test validation script [need]
          * Validate filenames
              * Complete src transition
          * Validate as well-formed XML or die
          * Validate as XHTML (but don't die if HTMLonly)
          * Validate CSS unless invalid flag (but don't die in case validator has bug)
          * Validate other format-related stuff?
      * Create index of tests by section, including title and assertions, to check for coverage [need] (may want to split report into one page per section for including assertion [want])
