====== Review Process ======

Additions and changes to the CSS2.1 Test Suite must be reviewed before they can be checked in.
Anyone with the ability to read and understand the [[http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/|spec]] and a
thorough understanding of the [[http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/guidelines.html|test suite guidelines]]
can review additions and changes to the tests in the CSS2.1 Test Suite, however

  * A reviewer cannot review his/her own tests and changes.
  * An employee of or contractor for a company cannot review tests submitted by that company unless he or she is an Owner or Peer.

The reviewer must check each test submitted for inclusion in the test suite for conformance
to the test suite guidelines and for correctness with respect to the specification. For
proposed changes to existing tests, the reviewer must check the changes for correctness.

If the test does not pass review, the reviewer must tell the submitter what is wrong with the
test and what steps should be taken to correct any problems. New tests and changes that have
been declined by one reviewer cannot be approved by someone else until the problems are
corrected or have been demonstrated to be invalid. In case of a conflict, an Owner or Peer's
opinion carries more weight.

In all cases the CSS Working Group has final say in whether a test is valid, and may be consulted if deemed necessary.

Once changes pass review, the reviewer must send notice of approval (which in the case of a
reviewer with write access can be the same as notice of the checkin) to the 
[[http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-css-testsuite/|public-css-testsuite mailing list]].
New tests and changes that have been reviewed and approved can be checked in by anyone with write
access, and that person is not required to perform any further review.

Changes to the harness (build scripts etc.), must be reviewed by a test suite Owner.

To request review, send proposed tests and changes to public-css-testsuite as described
in the [[test:css2.1:contribute|contribution guidelines]].

If these requirements change, notice will be sent to public-css-testsuite of the changes.



===== Owners and Peers =====

The test suite Owner is the person most responsible for the test suite. Previously
that was Ian Hickson (Hixie); currently that is Elika J. Etemad (fantasai). A Peer
is someone the test suite Owner considers equally capable of evaluating changes to
the test suite and responsible enough to have write access to the test suite. A
review from a Peer carries equal weight to a review from an Owner.

Currently the following people are Owners or Peers:

  * Anne van Kesteren
  * Elika J. Etemad (fantasai)
  * Ian Hickson (hixie) [INACTIVE]



===== Becoming a Peer =====

There are three basic qualifications you must satisfy to become a Peer:

  * You must demonstrate the ability to read and interpret the spec correctly.
  * You must demonstrate a thorough understanding of the test suite guidelines.
  * You must demonstrate that you are trustworthy.

The first two qualifications can be met by submitting good-quality tests for the test suite
and intelligently critiquing existing tests.

The second qualification is met by someone vouching for you. This could be a
test suite Owner or Peer, or it could be someone else trusted by an Owner.
For example, since fantasai trusts active members of the CSS Working Group,
an employee of Microsoft can ask his CSS Working Group representative, Markus
Mielke, to vouch. As another example, since fantasai trusts Mozilla module owners
and peers, a contributor to that project could ask one of them to vouch.
By vouching, a voucher is putting his or her reputation on the line, and is
confirming that the candidate has established enough credibility in the voucher's
experience that the voucher would entrust him or her with a similar level of
write privileges in their own project.

If the Owner is satisfied that a candidate would make a suitable Peer, s/he will
then request write access to dev.w3.org for the candidate and add him or her to
the Peers list.
