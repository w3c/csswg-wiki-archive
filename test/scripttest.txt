====== Script Tests ======

A //script test// is a test that uses JavaScript to programmatically verify one or more specific functionalities.  Unlike [[test:selftest|self-describing tests]] and [[test:reftest|reftests]], script tests do not verify rendering.

Script tests should be used to verify functionalities that do not require rendering, for example, a JavaScript API.  Script tests can also be used to add automation to [[test:reftest|reftests]] for clients that do not support [[test:reftest|reftests]].

==== Components of a Script Test ====

A script test can be written as a single file with a script block that contains the JavaScript, or the JavaScript can be contained in a separate .js file that is imported by the test file.

===== Test Harness =====

The test harness (written and maintained by James Graham) is a JavaScript file that facilitates writing test cases.  Specifically, test harness offers test authors:
  * A convenient API for making common test assertions
  * Support for testing synchronous and asynchronous DOM features in a way that promotes clear, robust, tests

Script tests written for the CSSWG //should// use test harness whenever possible.

==== Basic Usage ====

The basic usage of the harness ([[http://w3c-test.org/resources/testharness.js|testharness.js]]) is described in the beginning of the file.

==== Bug Reporting ====

The discussion forum for the test harness is the W3C's cross-WG [[http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-test-infra/|public-test-infra]] mail list. This list is also used to report testharness.js bugs or bugs can also be directly added to the W3C's Bugzilla: [[https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/describecomponents.cgi?product=Testing|Product = Testing; Component = testharness.js]] (James Graham is the "default assignee").
