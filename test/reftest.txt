====== Reftests ======

A //reftest// is a test that compares the visual output of one file (the testcase) with the output of one or more other files (the references). Unlike the standard [[test:selftest|self-describing tests]], reftests can be scripted to run and report results automatically.

A test can be both a [[test:selftest|self-describing tests]] and a reftest at the same time. This is preferable, since it allows for both machine comparison and manual verification--particularly useful if the test and the reference both render incorrectly in the same way!

<note example>

Here is an example of a reftest that is also a self-describing test:

  ; [[http://test.csswg.org/source/contributors/apple/incoming/css-2d-transforms/rotate-90deg-001.xht|TEST]]
  : The test file uses a fuchsia top border and an orange background to create a two-color square block that is then rotated 90deg using the ''transform'' property.
  ; [[http://test.csswg.org/source/contributors/apple/incoming/css-2d-transforms/reftest/rotate-90deg-001-ref.xht|REF]]
  : The reference file achieves the intended rendering by using a fuchsia left border and an orange background and no ''transform''.

</note>

In some cases, a test cannot be a reftest. For example, there is no way to create a reference for underlining, since the position and thickness of the underline depends on the UA, the font, and/or the platform. In such cases, a [[test:selftest|self-describing test]] must be used. However, once it's established that underlining an inline element works, it's possible to construct a reftest for the correct //propagation// of underlines from blocks to their descendant text, e.g. by constructing a reference that applies underlining to a ''<span>'' wrapped around the underlined text.

===== Components of a Reftest =====

A reftest has three parts:

  ; test file : The test file. This must follow the [[format|CSS test format guidelines]].
  ; reference file : This is a different, usually simpler, file that results in the same rendering as the test. The reference file must not use the same features that are being tested. Sometimes more than one reference file is required.
  ; reftest comparison : One or more reference links that say which files are to be compared and whether they are to render identically or differently.

==== The Reftest Test File ====

The test file uses the technology to be tested. This file must follow the [[format|CSS test format guidelines]].

In addition to matching a reftest reference, the test may also function as an self-describing test. This is preferred because having the description lets the tester check that the test and the reference are not //both// being rendered incorrectly and triggering a false pass, and because designing it for an obvious fail makes it easier to find what went wrong when the reftest does fail.

==== The Reftest Reference File ====

The reference file uses a different method to produce the same rendering as the test file. Multiple tests can (and often do) share the same reference file. 

References should be named after the earliest test that uses them in the ''test-topic'' series they belong to, and must have either ''-ref'' or ''-notref'' appended to the file name just before the file extension. Depending on the test suite, they may be placed in the ''reference'' subdirectory of the main test directory or directly in the main test directory. If they are placed in the ''reference'' subdirectory then the ''-ref'' or ''-notref'' suffix may be omitted from their filename.

In some cases when creating the reference file, it is necessary to use features that, although different from the tested features, may themselves fail in such a manner as to cause the reference to render identically to a failed test. When this is the case, in order to reduce the possibility of false positive testing outcomes, multiple reference files should be used, each using a different technique to render the reference. One possibility is to create one or more references that must **not** match the test file, i.e.: a file that renders in the same manner as a failed test.

In other cases, the specification under test may allow multiple possible renderings. In this situation references must be supplied for each allowed rendering.

<note example>
For example, if two self-describing tests ''list-style-type-003.xht'' and ''list-style-type-004.xht'' share the same reference, that reference could be named ''reftest/list-style-type-003-ref.xht''.

=== Simplified Reference Format ===

Like the format for the test file, the reftest reference format is also XHTML in UTF-8 with bitmap images in PNG format. Unlike the format for the test file, there is no metadata except for the [[format#credits|author credits]] and optional [[format#reference-links|reference links]].

<code html>
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd">

=== Common References ===

There are several common references, such as those used for parsing and selectors tests. Their names begin with ''ref-'' so they can be easily found in the ''reftest'' directory. Email public-css-testsuite@w3.org if you would like to add to the common references collection.

==== The Reftest Comparison Links ====

In order to designate which files are to be compared to the test file, and the nature of the comparison, the test file must have one or more links to the reference files [[format#reference-links|as described in the test format]].

  * If multiple reference files must be matched, each reference file should, in turn, link to the next reference.
  * If multiple renderings are conforming, each possible rendering should have its own reference file linked from the test file.
  * In cases where it's likely for the test and the reference to misrender identically, the test should also have one (or more) mismatch references.

===== The Reftest Manifest =====

Note: The use of reftest manifest files in the test source is deprecated in favor of reference links.

The reftest manifest is a plain text file that lists test-reference pairs for comparison. The test build process produces reftest manifests as needed for input into testing tools.

Each line starts with ''=='' to indicate equality or ''!='' to indicate inequality. This is followed by a space, the relative path to the test file, another space, and the relative path to the reference.

If a test has multiple ''=='' references then at least one of those references must match the test. If a test has multiple ''!='' references, then none of those references may match the test. The reference file may also have entries in the manifest: in this case, the renderings of the references must match each other as well in order to consider the test as passed.

White space followed by ''#'' indicates the start of a comment that runs until the end of the line. A line starting with ''#'' is also a comment.

The reftest manifest should be named ''reftest.list'' and placed in the ''reference'' subdirectory of the main test directory.

<note example>
Here is an example of a reftest manifest.

<code>
# reftest.list snippet
== ../test-topic-000.xht test-topic-000-ref.xht
== ../test-topic-001.xht test-topic-001-ref.xht
== ../test-topic-002.xht test-topic-000-ref.xht # note same reference as test 000
</code>

[[http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/layout/tools/reftest/README.txt|Mozilla's manifest format]], which is more-or-less a superset of the W3C format, allows annotations such as whether the test is expected to pass or fail. These can be useful when setting up automated regression testing.

===== Converting to Reftest =====

Most of the CSS2.1 tests are self-describing tests that //could// be reftests, but are not. (They were written before the reftest format was adopted.) They are slowly being converted into reftests, and your help in this effort is welcome. Some guidelines are offered below:

  * If the test uses Ahem, make sure its font size is a multiple of 5px, otherwise it may render inconsistently (due to rounding errors introduced by certain platforms' font APIs).
  * If multiple tests can share a reference, share the reference. (This allows for some optimizations in the test runs.)
  * If multiple files have almost but not quite the same rendering, and could almost but not quite render identically and thus share a reference, you may tweak the tests to render identically **provided that** this does not affect the tests' precision or correctness.

==== Unreftestable ====

The following is a list of CSS2.1 tests that appear to be unreftestable:
