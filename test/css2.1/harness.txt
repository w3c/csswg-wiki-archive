====== Test Suite Harness ======

This page records information about setting up the CSS2.1 test suite and known issues with the test harness.

The CSS2.1 Test Suite's final format is generated by a makefile from the XHTML 1.1 source files. To run this process on your own computer, you will need:

**This has not been tested on Windows.**

  * **Standard unix commandline tools** If you're on Windows, you need to install [[http://www.cygwin.com/|Cygwin]]. The scripts currently rely on a lot of unix-specific shortcuts like ''xargs''.
  * **make** GNU make is available on most *nix systems as ''make'' or ''gmake''.
  * **Perl** Perl is available on Windows through [[http://www.cygwin.com/|Cygwin]] (make sure you check the box to install perl) and through the [[http://www.activestate.com/Products/ActivePerl/|ActivePerl]] distribution. It is usually pre-installed on *nix; install the ''perl'' package if it's not.
  * **Perl's ''XML::Parser'' module** Run <code>perl -MCPAN -e "install 'XML::Parser'"</code> to get it from CPAN.
  * **ImageMagick**, which is needed for PNG->JPEG conversion in the xhtml1print format, can be downloaded from [[http://imagemagick.org/|imagemagick.org]]

Once you have the pre-requisites set up,

  - Acquire a copy of the test suite source, e.g. by [[test:cvs|checking out]] the ''CSS/CSS2.1-test-suite'' directory from dev.w3.org.
  - Run ''make'' within the ''CSS2.1-test-suite'' directory

The finished tests will be in the newly-created ''dist'' directory.




===== Harness Issues =====

  * revamp the filename format to be simpler (''some-words-##.xht'')
  * move flags from the filename into a <meta> tag
  * add flags for "continuous media specific test" and "paged media specific test"
  * auto-add flags from meta to filename during build process
  * update the Guidelines with the new template, new flags, and new filename format
  * make sure build scripts are adding all tests to the index
  * make sure build scripts add title to rel="help" links
  * check build instructions for Windows
  * set up a 'latest' test suite directory that gets a daily update of the test suite
