====== Test Suite Build System ======

The CSS2.1 Test Suite's final format is generated from the XHTML 1.1 source files with a set of Python scripts. These can be found in the tools/ directory of the [[http://test.csswg.org/|test suite repository]].

===== Build Requirements =====

  * Python 2.6 or higher
  * The [[http://tt2.org/python/|Template-Python module]]
  * A [[http://test.csswg.org/source/tools/CSSTestLib/html5lib.patch|patched]] copy of the Python [[http://code.google.com/p/html5lib/|html5lib]] module
  * Perl 5
  * A full checkout of the [[http://test.csswg.org/|test repository]]

===== Build Instructions =====

  * To build all tests, run the ''tools/pub-css21.pl'' script from the root of your test repository checkout.
  * To build only approved tests, run the ''tools/build-css21.py'' script from the root of your test repository checkout.
  * In both cases, the built test suite will be in ''dist/''.
