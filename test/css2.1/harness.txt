====== Test Suite Harness ======

This page records information about setting up the CSS2.1 test suite and known issues with the test harness.

The CSS2.1 Test Suite's final format is generated by a makefile from the XHTML 1.1 source files. To run this process on your own computer, you will need:

NEED TO TEST ON WINDOWS

  * make
      * GNU make is available on most *nix systems as ''make'' or ''gmake''.
  * Perl
      * Perl is available on Windows through [[http://www.cygwin.com/|Cygwin]] (make sure you check the box to install perl) and through the [[http://www.activestate.com/Products/ActivePerl/|ActivePerl]] distribution.
      * Perl is usually pre-installed on *nix. Install the ''perl'' package if it's not.
  * Perl's expat XML parser

Once you have the pre-requisites set up,

  - Acquire a copy of the test suite source, e.g. by [[test:cvs|checking out]] the ''CSS/CSS2.1-test-suite'' directory from dev.w3.org.
  - Run ''make'' within the ''CSS2.1-test-suite'' directory

The finished tests will be in the newly-created ''dist'' directory.
