====== CSS2.1 Test Suite Tests Needing Data ======

The CSS2.1 Test Suite results are tracked by the submission of formal implementation reports and from the data in the test suite harness. [add links]

See notes on [[http://wiki.csswg.org/test/css2.1/results|previous list]].

This page tracks tests that do not have sufficient data to exit CR, these tests are likely blocking CR exit.

  * <del>absolute-replaced-height-006</del> - Passed by Gecko, IE9, Opera 11
  * <del>absolute-replaced-height-013</del> - Passed by Gecko, IE9, Opera 11
  * <del>absolute-replaced-height-020</del> - Passed by Gecko, IE9, Opera 11
  * <del>absolute-replaced-height-027</del> - Passed by Gecko, IE9, Opera 11
  * <del>absolute-replaced-height-034</del> - Passed by Gecko, IE9, Opera 11
  * <del>bidi-breaking-002</del> - original test Passed by WebKit; split into bidi-breaking-002 with multiple passes and bidi-breaking-003 that is a "may" test (not passed by Chromium for dbaron, though!)
  * <del>block-replaced-height-006</del> - Passed by Gecko, IE9
  * <del>containing-block-017</del> - Passed by WebKit, IE9 - Arron to clarify pass condition text
  * <del>containing-block-018</del> - Passed by WebKit, IE9 - Arron to clarify pass condition text
  * content-computed-value-001 - Passed by Trident; probably easy to fix in Gecko; test should probably be redesigned anyway and isn't testing what was intended (fantasai will rewrite)
  * cursor-024 - Passed by Gecko; should probably change the test to a MAY
  * dynamic-top-change-005 - Passed by Gecko; IE9 and WebKit have dynamic change bug (fixed by forced relayout); WebKit and Opera have bug with rel-pos inline as containing block (fixed if block); dbaron to split test (to 005,005a,005b) but leave existing test so that we have two subtests with two passes each and can make a decent argument about implementability even though we only have one pass on the combined test (since it's all part of the same feature)
  * <del>float-replaced-height-006</del> - Passed by Gecko, IE9, Opera 11
  * <del>inline-block-replaced-height-006</del> - Passed by Gecko, IE9, Opera 11
  * <del>inline-replaced-height-006</del> - Passed by Gecko, IE9, Opera 11
  * [[test:css2.1:blocking:margin-collapse|margin-collapse-164]] - Passed by WebToPDF; this is the same issue as margin-collapse-clear-005 and margin-collapse-clear-011, Gecko patch is available ([[https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=376365|bug]]) but we need to discuss whether the tests are really correct (and if we fix these tests we break Acid2)
  * <del>run-in-fixedpos-between-002</del> - Passed by Trident. Run-ins are proposed to be moved to CSS3
  * <del>run-in-float-between-002</del> - Passed by Trident. Run-ins are proposed to be moved to CSS3
  * table-anonymous-objects-188 - Passed by Gecko
