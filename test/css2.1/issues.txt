====== Record of Known Bugs ======

This page records known problems in the [[test:css2.1|CSS 2.1 Conformance Test Suite]]. For problems with the harness, see [[harness]].

To record a bug, post to public-css-testsuite@w3.org explaining the problem. Then link to it from this wiki using the test name as the link text. Like this:

  * [[http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-css-testsuite/2007Jul/0011.html|t1202-counter-09-b]]

Put the test in the most severe group (earliest below) that applies.
==== Tests that are Wrong or have Parse Errors ====

Refer to nonexistent fonts:
  font-weight-bolder-001
  font-weight-lighter-001
  font-weight-normal-001
==== Tests that need Usability improvements ====

Ugly, not self-documenting:
  background-alpha-001
  background-alpha-002
  background-alpha-003
  background-alpha-004
  background-alpha-005

Should state that red is failure:
  active-selector-002

Confusing/hard to judge:
  background-attachment-004
  background-position-201
  background-root-018
  bidi-override-003: should state whether a bullet should be visible
  border-001: solid or hollow box?
  c525-font-wt-000: does not state whether "This sentence should be very light" should be visibly lighter than normal
  fixed-table-layout-006: "all the blue lines" is confusing. They are all shades of blue.
  inline-block-003: behavior on window resize needs to be clarified:
  floats-126 et al: ditto
  inlines-004-inlines-006: unclear what "aligned" means. Say "on a grid"?

Need pixel reference lines:
  c527-font-001
  c527-font-002
  c527-font-004
  c527-font-005
  c527-font-007
  c527-font-008
  c527-font-009
  c527-font-10

Should be ref tests:
  c5526c-display-000
==== Tests that have HTML Validation errors ====
==== Tests that need Metadata improvements ====

Tests possibly missing http flag:
  character-encoding-026
  character-encoding-027
  character-encoding-028
  lang-selector-005

==== General Issues ====

Some tests are assuming the system has access to glyphs for non-Latin fonts. If this isn't the case, the test could pass without actually testing anything.
