<dfn>FIXME</dfn>
: A fix is proposed in the Resolution section, but has not coded and/or checked in.

<dfn>VERIFYME</dfn>
: A fix has been checked in, someone else needs to verify.

<dfn>INVALID</dfn>
: There is no bug. Record an explanation in the Resolution section and wait for someone else to verify and remove the bug record.

<dfn>POORDESC</dfn>
: Not enough information in the summary or discussion to understand the problem and create a fix. The reporter needs to clarify. The issue may be deleted without a fix if the reporter is unresponsive.
</markdown>

A bug record is removed once someone else has either verified the fix, or verified that the bug is indeed invalid.

==== Tests Assume Non-Latin Font Availability ====

Discussion
: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-css-testsuite/2007Jul/0011.html

: Some tests are assuming the system has access to glyphs for non-Latin fonts. If this isn't the case, the test could pass without actually testing anything.

Resolution

: Need tests to fail if glyphs are not available.

Status
: NEEDSFIX
