====== Contributing to the CSS2.1 Test Suite ======

The CSS2.1 Test Suite still needs a lot of work, and the CSS Working Group can't finish it all by itself. Anyone can contribute: here are the guidelines.

  * All contributions are governed by the [[http://www.w3.org/|W3C]]'s [[http://www.w3.org/2004/10/27-testcases.html|Policies for Contribution of Test Cases]]. The CSS Working Group also makes its tests available under the <a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php">BSD 3-clause license</a>, so contributors must also agree to license their contributions under that license.
  * All tests must conform to the [[http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/guidelines.html|CSS2.1 Test Suite Guidelines]].
  * All tests must adhere to the template below.

====== How to Contribute a New Test ======







===== Template for New Tests =====

The baseline format for CSS2.1 tests is XHTML 1.1. Images must be in PNG format. A set of scripts generate the various formats from this source version.

Copy and paste the following text into a new file, or save this file, and replace the capitalized parts [[test:css2.1:format|as described in the format guidelines]].

<code html>
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.1//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml11/DTD/xhtml11.dtd">
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
 <head>
  <title>CSS 2.1 Test Suite: DESCRIPTION OF TEST</title>
  <link rel="author" title="NAME_OF_AUTHOR" href="mailto:EMAIL OR http://CONTACT_PAGE"/>
  <link rel="help" href="RELEVANT_SPEC_SECTION"/>
  <meta name="flags" content="TOKENS" />
  <meta name="assert" content="TEST ASSERTION"/>
  <style type="text/css"><![CDATA[

 <body>
  CONTENT OF TEST

</html>
</code>





===== Submitting the New Test =====

You can submit a new test by [[http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-css-testsuite/|sending it to public-css-testsuite@w3.org]]. If you're not submitting on behalf of a CSS Working Group Member organization, you'll have to fill out [[http://www.w3.org/2002/09/wbs/1/testgrants2-200409/|this form]] to give W3C permission to use your tests. New tests are subject to the [[test:css2.1:review|review process]].



====== How to Report a Problem in the Test Suite ======

  - First check the [[test:css2.1:issues|Known Problems list]] to see if your problem has already been reported. If it hasn't, then
  - Send an email to [[http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-css-testsuite/|public-css-testsuite@w3.org]] describing the problem
  - Ideally, also add it to the [[test:css2.1:issues|Known Problems list]] once your post shows up in the [[http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-css-testsuite/|public-css-testsuite mail archives]]


====== How to Contribute a Fix to an Existing Test ======

To contribute a fix to an existing test, send an email to [[http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-css-testsuite/|public-css-testsuite@w3.org]] with both

  * an explanation of the problem or a reference to a previous message explaining the problem
  * the precise changes necessary to fix the problem (preferably as a diff either against the [[test:cvs|CVS]] source copy or against the XHTML1.1 version)

Fixes to existing tests are also subject to the [[test:css2.1:review|review process]].



====== Other Ways to Contribute ======

  * You can subscribe to the [[http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-css-testsuite/|public-css-testsuite mailing list]] and [[test:css2.1:review|review]] test submissions as they come in.
  * You can go through the issues marked VERIFYME in the [[test:css2.1:issues|Known Problems list]], verify that they are indeed fixed in the [[http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/CSS2.1/current/|latest version]], and remove them from the known bugs list.

====== What to Do If You Receive No Response ======

If you've waited at least a week and your contribution seems to be going nowhere, please complain to the test suite owner (currently [[http://fantasai.inkedblade.net/contact|fantasai]]). No, really, please do complain if this is the case.
