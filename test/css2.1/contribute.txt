====== Contributing to the CSS2.1 Test Suite ======

The CSS2.1 Test Suite still needs a lot of work, and the CSS Working Group can't finish it all by itself. Anyone can contribute: here are the guidelines.

  * All contributions are governed by the [[http://www.w3.org/|W3C]]'s [[http://www.w3.org/2004/10/27-testcases.html|Policies for Contribution of Test Cases]].
  * All tests must conform to the [[http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/guidelines.html|CSS2.1 Test Suite Guidelines]] except the part about limiting filenames to 31 characters.
  * All tests must adhere to the template below (not the one in the guidelines).

====== How to Contribute a New Test ======







===== Template for New Tests =====

The baseline format for CSS2.1 tests is XHTML 1.1. Images must be in PNG format. A set of scripts generate the various formats from this source version.

Copy and paste the following text into a new file, or save this file, and replace the capitalized parts [[test:css2.1:format|as described in the format guidelines]].

<code html>
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.1//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml11/DTD/xhtml11.dtd">
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
 <head>
  <title>CSS 2.1 Test Suite: DESCRIPTION OF TEST</title>
  <link rel="author" title="NAME_OF_AUTHOR" href="mailto:EMAIL OR http://CONTACT_PAGE"/>
  <link rel="help" href="RELEVANT_SPEC_SECTION"/>
  <meta name="flags" content="TOKENS" />

  <style type="text/css"><![CDATA[

</code>


===== Submitting the New Test =====

You can submit a new test by [[http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-css-testsuite/|sending it to public-css-testsuite@w3.org]].


====== How to Contribute a Fix to an Existing Test ======

To contribute a fix to an existing test, send an email to [[http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-css-testsuite/|public-css-testsuite@w3.org]] with both

  * an explanation of the problem or a reference to a previous message explaining the problem
  * the precise changes necessary to fix the problem (preferably as a diff)

Fixes to existing tests are also subject to the [[test:css2.1:review|review process]].

====== What to Do If You Receive No Response ======

If you've waited at least a week and your contribution seems to be going nowhere, please complain to the test suite owner (currently [[http://fantasai.inkedblade.net/contact|fantasai]]). No, really, please do complain if this is the case.
