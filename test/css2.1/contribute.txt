====== Contributing to the CSS Test Suites ======

Anyone can contribute: here are the guidelines.

  * All tests must conform to the [[http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/guidelines.html|CSS2.1 Test Suite Guidelines]].
  * All tests must also adhere to the [[test:css2.1:format|format guidelines]].
  * The tests are intended to be released under both the [[http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/2002/copyright-documents-20021231|W3C Document License]] and the [[http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php|BSD 3-clause license]], so unless represent a W3C Member, you must give your explicit permission for us to use your contributions under these licenses.

===== How to License Your Contribution =====

The test suite is licensed under both the [[http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/2008/04-testsuite-license|W3C Test Suite License]] and the [[http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/2008/03-bsd-license|3-clause BSD License]].

To give us permission to distribute your contribution under these two licenses, you need to fill out [[http://www.w3.org/2002/09/wbs/1/testgrants2-200409/|W3C's license grant form]] (unless you or your company is a member of the CSS Working Group, in which case you're covered already).

===== How to Submit a New Test =====

You can submit a new test by

  - Sending us permission to use the test as described above.
  - Either uploading the test into your ''submitted'' directory [[http://hg.csswg.org/test/file/tip/contributors|in the Mercurial repository]] OR, if you don't have write access, sending the test to [[http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-css-testsuite/|public-css-testsuite@w3.org]] as a link or attachment and asking someone else to upload it. If you are submitting tests for CSS2.1, you can also [[http://www.gtalbot.org/BrowserBugsSection/css21testsuite/web-authors-contributions-css21-testsuite.html|contact Gérard Talbot]] for assistance.

To obtain write access to the repository, make sure you have an account on this wiki, and send an email to [[http://fantasai.inkedblade.net/contact|fantasai]] requesting access.

Instructions on how to use the Mercurial repository are available [[test:mercurial|here]].

Please make sure submissions follow the [[http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/guidelines.html|CSS2.1 Test Suite Guidelines]]. New tests are subject to the [[test:css2.1:review|review process]]. We may ask you to fix problems in your test and resubmit it before adding it to the test suite.

===== How to Report a Problem in the Test Suite =====

  - First check the [[test:css2.1:issues|Known Problems list]] to see if your problem has already been reported. If it hasn't, then
  - Send an email to [[http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-css-testsuite/|public-css-testsuite@w3.org]] describing the problem
  - Ideally, also add it to the [[test:css2.1:issues|Known Problems list]] once your post shows up in the [[http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-css-testsuite/|public-css-testsuite mail archives]]


===== How to Contribute a Fix to an Existing Test =====

To contribute a fix to an existing test, send an email to [[http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-css-testsuite/|public-css-testsuite@w3.org]] with both

  * an explanation of the problem or a reference to a previous message explaining the problem
  * the precise changes necessary to fix the problem (preferably as a diff either against the [[http://hg.csswg.org/test|Mercurial source copy]] or against the XHTML1.1 version)

Fixes to existing tests are also subject to the [[test:css2.1:review|review process]].

===== Other Ways to Contribute =====

  * You can subscribe to the [[http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-css-testsuite/|public-css-testsuite mailing list]] and [[test:css2.1:review|review]] test submissions as they come in.
  * You can help fix test submissions in response to review comments.
  * You can go through the issues marked as fixed in the [[test:css2.1:issues|Known Problems list]], verify that they are indeed fixed in the [[http://test.csswg.org/suites/css2.1/latest/|latest version]], and remove them from the known bugs list.
