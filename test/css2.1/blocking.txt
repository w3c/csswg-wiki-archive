===== Tests Currently Blocking =====

==== Tests Expecting Implementation Updates ====

  * <del>[[test:css2.1:blocking:at-rule-013|at-rule-013]]</del> - Passed by Trident. Expecting implementation from Gecko (patch available, ETA FF 4.1) -Tantek
  * <del>[[test:css2.1:blocking:background-intrinsic|background-intrinsic-004]]</del> - No Passes. Expecting impls from WebKit - soon and Gecko soon after FF4.
  * <del>[[test:css2.1:blocking:background-intrinsic|background-intrinsic-005]]</del> - No Passes. Expecting impls from WebKit - soon and Gecko soon after FF4.
  * quotes-035 - Passed by Gecko  (David) - Opera has [[http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-css-testsuite/2011Jan/0095.html|two small bugs]] to implement this
  * [[test:css2.1:blocking:replaced-intrinsic-ratio-001|replaced-intrinsic-ratio-001]] - No Passes (expecting impl. from Gecko); Opera can fix as well. [[https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=53099|Webkit bug]]

==== Tests Expecting Spec Changes ====

  * <del>containing-block-032 - Passed by Trident (IE7 only, not IE9) (David) [[https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=53106|Webkit bug]] [[https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=489100|Gecko bug]];</del> we should try to make this undefined since it seems we're unlikely to get a fix in the near future. Fantasai to propose text.
  * <del>[[test:css2.1:blocking:bidi-004|bidi-004]] - No Passes. Leave undefined for 2.1. Split test into 'may' and 004a subset.</del>
  * <del>first-line-pseudo-016 - Passed by Gecko (David)</del> - Changed to MAY; Remove valign from the list

==== Tests Needing Breakup or Implementation ====

  * forced-page-breaks-000 - Passed by Prince. Need second pass.
  * orphans-004a - Prince passes, everyone else fails. If we removed orphans:0; IE9 would start to pass.
  * bidi-004a - Split off from bidi-004. Needs passes. (FF4? IE9? Opera and Webkit fail.)
