====== CSS2.1 Test Suite Invalid Tests ======

The CSS2.1 Test Suite results are tracked by the submission of formal implementation reports and from the data in the test suite harness. [add links]

This page tracks tests that have been reported as invalid. The tests have all been fixed, and need verification.

==== Updated but need review ====
Once the cases are reviewed please remove the cases from the list below
  * border-bottom-width-036 - rounding issues: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-css-testsuite/2010Oct/0123.html
  * border-bottom-width-047
  * border-left-width-036
  * border-left-width-047
  * border-right-width-036
  * border-right-width-047
  * border-top-width-036
  * border-top-width-047
  * padding-bottom-047 - seems similar to border-* cases? (http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-css-testsuite/2010Oct/0123.html)
  * padding-bottom-036
  * padding-left-036
  * padding-left-047
  * padding-right-036
  * padding-right-047
  * padding-top-036
  * padding-top-047

These tests were split into ###a and ###b variants (see http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-css-testsuite/2010Dec/0097.html):
  * bidi-005
  * bidi-006
  * bidi-007
  * bidi-008
  * bidi-009
  * bidi-010

This test was a) corrected and b) split. Webkit and FF need to fix their implementations. Opera has an additional bug they will need to address as well.
  * text-decoration-087 - Test corrected and split into 087 and 089. 

These tests received various fixes:
  * background-bg-pos-205 - It's up to the UA whether to scroll the <p /> tag at the bottom. change the test to p{ margin:2em;margin-top:0; }.
  * block-in-inline-relpos-002 - [[http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-css-testsuite/2011Jan/0100.html|proposal from dbaron]], [[http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-css-testsuite/2011Feb/0009.html|test fixed]]
  * font-family-rule-002 - email thread: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-css-testsuite/2010Oct/0263.html</del> - updated for RC5
  * page-grammar-001 - Updated to be less confusing.
  * page-grammar-002 - Updated to be less confusing.
  * rtl-linebreak - add a negative reference without a border (because the invalidity is that the reference doesn't detect the WebKit failure) - [[http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-css-testsuite/2011Jan/0101.html|done by dbaron]]
  * z-index-020 - outlines can validly be drawn on 2 (maybe 3?) different layers, and this test requires them to be drawn onto one particular layer. Updated.

==== Deferred to CSS3 ====

  * floats-wrap-bfc-006b - Move test to CSS3
  * floats-wrap-bfc-006c - move test to CSS3

==== No edits necessary ====

I did not update these cases because there are no pixel rounding issues in the cases. 25.4mm is equal to 96px.
  * padding-bottom-050
  * padding-bottom-051
  * padding-left-050
  * padding-left-051
  * padding-right-050
  * padding-right-051
  * padding-top-050
  * padding-top-051


These tests had no change or just metadata updates:
  * forced-page-breaks-000 - CSS3 semantics, but do not impact the test result. OK to leave.
  * forced-page-breaks-001 - CSS3 semantics, but do not impact the test result. OK to leave.
  * page-break-after-010 - CSS3 semantics, but do not impact the test result. OK to leave.
  * page-break-before-003 - CSS3 semantics, but do not impact the test result. OK to leave.
  * page-break-before-005 - CSS3 semantics, but do not impact the test result. OK to leave.
  * page-break-before-020 - Test is OK

These tests received metadata updates, but no substantive changes:

  * list-style-position-004 - Flagged as MAY.
  * page-breaks-101 - Assert updated. OK.
  * page-container-004 - Flagged as may. OK.
