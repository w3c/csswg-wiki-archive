==== Discussion ====

Test fails because implementations don't resize the image before applying background-position.

[Simon] I've looked into fixing this in WebKit <https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=47156>; it's do-able but not trivial.

[dbaron] Also see [[https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=597778|Gecko bug]].  I think we're not following one of the rules in the spec (see comment 8 in the bug).

[Simon] We expect to get 2 implementations (WebKit, Gecko?)
