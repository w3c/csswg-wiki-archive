====== Build System Planning ======

The CSS2.1 build scripts have a lot of problems. They kinda need a rehaul. This page is for planning the rehaul. We start by cataloging the problems...

===== Build Script Problems and Missing Features =====

==== Major Issues ====

  * filter HTMLonly and XMLonly tests during test generation
  * handle .htaccess merging
  * don't munge SGML comments or whitespace
  * preserve DOCTYPEs across conversion
  * handle structured directories
  * Figure out how to build a cross 2.1 / 3 test suite that doesn't require hosting multiple copies on w3.org or has some other way of letting us identify common test results in the results system?	

==== Tooling Issues ====

Changes to the build system should make its parts easier to use for other purposes, and to generally improve its usefulness to testers and test writers.

  * incremental builds
  * live copy of test suite
  * break-downable list of all filenames
  * search on test metadata
  * sync support files (and reftest supports)

==== Minor issues ====

Minor improvements that don't affect architecture.

  * generate HTML comments corresponding to requirements
  * have build scripts add title to rel=“help” links
  * add UTF-8 charset metatags to HTML files
  * build zip file
