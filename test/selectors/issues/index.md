# Record of Known Bugs

This page records known problems in the [Selectors Conformance Test Suite](../../../test/selectors/ "test:selectors"). For problems with the harness, see [harness](../../../test/selectors/harness/ "test:selectors:harness").

## Lifecyle of a Bug

Valid status markers:

\<markdown\> \<dfn\>NEEDSFIX\</dfn\> : Initial value.

\<dfn\>NEEDSINFO\</dfn\> : Needs more information (e.g. from the working group or someone more knowledgeable about the spec) before a fix can be designed.

\<dfn\>🚧\</dfn\> : A fix is proposed in the Resolution section, but has not coded and/or checked in.

\<dfn\>VERIFYME\</dfn\> : A fix has been checked in, someone else needs to verify.

\<dfn\>INVALID\</dfn\> : There is no bug. Record an explanation in the Resolution section and wait for someone else to verify and remove the bug record.

\<dfn\>POORDESC\</dfn\> : Not enough information in the summary or discussion to understand the problem and create a fix. The reporter needs to clarify. The issue may be deleted without a fix if the reporter is unresponsive. \</markdown\>

A bug record is removed once someone else has either verified the fix, or verified that the bug is indeed invalid.
