This page records known problems in the [[test:selectors|Selectors Conformance Test Suite]]. For problems with the harness, see [[harness]].

===== Lifecyle of a Bug =====

Valid status markers:

<markdown>
<dfn>NEEDSFIX</dfn>
: Initial value.

<dfn>NEEDSINFO</dfn>
: Needs more information (e.g. from the working group or someone more knowledgeable about the spec) before a fix can be designed.

<dfn>FIXME</dfn>
: A fix is proposed in the Resolution section, but has not coded and/or checked in.

<dfn>VERIFYME</dfn>
: A fix has been checked in, someone else needs to verify.

<dfn>INVALID</dfn>
: There is no bug. Record an explanation in the Resolution section and wait for someone else to verify and remove the bug record.

<dfn>POORDESC</dfn>
: Not enough information in the summary or discussion to understand the problem and create a fix. The reporter needs to clarify. The issue may be deleted without a fix if the reporter is unresponsive.
</markdown>

A bug record is removed once someone else has either verified the fix, or verified that the bug is indeed invalid.
