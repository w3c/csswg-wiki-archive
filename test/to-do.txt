====== To-do ======

This is an outline of tasks that need done around the CSS WG's testsuites.

===== Automation =====

Note that pending the first bulletpoint here, the counts of manual tests may be inaccurate.

  * Make sure documentation and metadata is sufficient to be able to get automated tests from the full testinfo.data
  * Conversion of CSS 2.1 tests to reftests. (4474 of 10369 are manual.)
  * Conversion of CSS Counter Styles Level 3 to reftests. (157 of 157 are manual.)
  * Conversion of CSS Fonts Module tests to reftests. (233 of 386 are manual.)
  * Conversion of CSS Shapes Module tests to reftests. (89 of 184 are manual.)
  * Conversion of CSS UI Module tests to reftests. (152 of 200 are manual.)
  * Conversion of CSS Backgrounds tests to reftests. (320 to 562 are manual.)
  * Construction of the cookie-dispensing machine.
  * Look for any reftests that Opera has for anything.

===== Clean-up =====

  * Try to fix build warnings.
  * Clean up the work-in-progress folders, because there's likely more cruft waiting to be removed.
  * Prod people to move stuff out of the work-in-progress folders, or do it yourself. (Some are likely de-facto abandoned, like the Opera tests.)
