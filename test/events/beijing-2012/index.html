===== Random Notes =====
  * Ms2ger [[http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-css-testsuite/2012Aug/0049|mentioned]] that CSSOM tests submitted last time often disagreed with the specification. Reviewers targeting this spec should probably spend some time getting familiar with [[http://dev.w3.org/2006/webapi/WebIDL/|WebIDL]] (and perhaps some concepts in ECMAScript5). If anyone can help with [[http://www.w3.org/html/ig/zh/wiki/WebIDL|the translation effort]], it will be much appreciated!
  * Reviewers targeting css3-flexbox might want to spend some time on [[http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visudet.html|Chapter 10 of CSS 2.1]] (Visual formatting model details) too ([[http://www.w3.org/html/ig/zh/wiki/CSS2/visudet/zh-hans|translation available]]).
  * For presenting "File the best bug", Zhiqiang is welcome to use any parts from fantasai's [[http://fantasai.inkedblade.net/style/talks/filing-good-bugs/|slides]] (or so I think. I am certainly fine with my translation reused. I am almost sure fantasai's fine but you might want to check with her). It's language negotiated (to /en, /zh-hant or /zh-hans).
