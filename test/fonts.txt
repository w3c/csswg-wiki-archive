====== Fonts for CSS Testing ======

If you don't have the CSS testing fonts installed, many tests will appear to fail! Install the [[http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/Fonts/|CSS Testing Fonts]] if you want accurate test results.

===== The Ahem Font =====

Many of the tests in the CSS Test Suite rely on the [[http://dev.w3.org/CSS/fonts/ahem/|Ahem font]]. Ahem's glyphs are all rectangles, which makes it easy to test the inline box model. More details are available in the [[http://dev.w3.org/CSS/fonts/ahem/README|Ahem README file]].

The Ahem font is available in several formats for different systems. If we are missing yours, and you can create one, we would welcome your contribution. Send us a message on the [[http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-css-testsuite|public-css-testsuite mailing list]].
