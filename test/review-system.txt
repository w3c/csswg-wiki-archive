====== Requirements for a Test Review System ======

See also [[http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-css-testsuite/2008Apr/0025.html|outline of a CSS test suite review system]] and [[http://wiki.csswg.org/test/css2.1/review|Review Process Documentation]].

  * Check off X tests and give them all the same comment
  * Find test by ID, URL, title, etc.
  * Handle renaming of test
  * Track changes in same stream as comments (every subversion checkin adds a comment pointing to diff and new version)
  * Track status of test (needs review, needs work, etc)
  * Accept comments
  * Be test suite aware (which test belongs to which test suite); note that a test may belong to multiple test suites
  * Opt-in to hear comments on tests you reviewed (and accepted but second-level review found problems with?)
  * Easy to set up an account
  * Bulk submit preserving folder structure
  * Should work on all browsers
