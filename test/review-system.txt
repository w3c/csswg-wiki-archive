  * Check off X tests and give them all the same comment
  * Find test by ID, URL, title, etc.
  * Handle renaming of test
  * Track changes in same stream as comments
  * Track status of test (needs review, needs work, etc)
  * Accept comments
  * Be test suite aware (which test belongs to which test suite)
  * Opt-in to hear comments on tests you reviewed (and accepted but second-level review found problems with?)
  * Easy to set up an account
