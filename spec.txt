====== Specification Issues and Planning ======
This section documents problems found in the CSS specs and working drafts. Problems documented here will be addressed by the editors, possibly after discussion in a CSS Working Group meeting, and will result in changes, corrections, clarifications, or no change.

===== REC or PR =====
Awaiting 2.1 to go PR (so these can go REC)
  * [[spec:css3-selectors|Selectors Level 3]]
  * [[spec:css3-color|CSS Color Module Level 3]]
PR as of 2011-04-12 (so not sure why the two above didn't automatically go to REC)
  * [[spec:css2.1|CSS Level 2 Revision 1]]

===== CR =====
Awaiting implementations, test suites, or actively being revised per implementation experience.
  * [[spec:css3-ui|CSS Basic User Interface Module Level 3]] (another LCWD expected)

  * [[spec:css-style-attr|CSS Style Attributes]]
  * [[spec:css3-background|CSS Backgrounds and Borders Module Level 3]]
  * [[spec:css3-regions|CSS Regions Module]]

===== WD =====
These are being actively developed. Sometimes used to be CRs that need major revision.
