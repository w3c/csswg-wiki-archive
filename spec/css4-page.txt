====== Paged Media Level 4 ======

//Consider separating page model (headers/footers) and pagination/fragmentation rools. Possibly [[CSS Pagination]] or [[CSS Fragmentation]]. CSSWG has discussed options and appears to prefer a separate pagination spec, to avoid having CSS3 specs (e.g. Regions) depend on a CSS4 spec. Also, a spearate pagination spec can have its own progress on standards track, and it doesn't have to depend on CSS3 Paged Media.//

Some ideas for features for a future Paged Media Level 4 spec:

  * 'allow' value for page-break properties (preferred vs acceptable breaks)
  * :blank page selector
  * some of what's currently in GCPM
  * [[http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2009Mar/0065.html|top-of-page margin collapsing control]]
  * ability to control total pages counter
  * ability to repeat table captions, change text slightly (add '(cont.)', etc)
  * ability to [[http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2008Nov/0280.html|wrap rows]]
  * ability to apply widows/orphans pagination controls to table rows in a table (vs lines in a paragraph)
  * add percentage to page-break-before(after) as conditional page break.  (See http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2009Apr/0039.html)
  * :front and :back page selectors (like :left and :right, but determined by writing order)
  * @margin-box selector to set values common to all margin boxes
  * pagination creates multiple boxes per element - that has to be accounted for in spec definitions and in DOM (http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2011Jun/0039.html)
  * containing block definition in pagination, in particular when broken across pages of different size (http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2011Jun/0039.html)
  * How multi-box or multi-line floats split across a boundary, and if there are heuristics for avoiding such a split if the entire floated element could display intact in the element past the boundary.
