====== Paged Media Level 4 ======

Some ideas for features for a future Paged Media Level 4 spec:

  * 'allow' value for page-break properties (preferred vs acceptable breaks)
  * :blank page selector
  * some of what's currently in GCPM
  * top-of-page margin collapsing control?
  * ability to control total pages counter
  * ability to repeat table captions, change text slightly (add '(cont.)', etc)
