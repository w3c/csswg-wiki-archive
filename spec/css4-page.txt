====== Paged Media Level 4 ======

Some ideas for features for a future Paged Media Level 4 spec:

  * 'allow' value for page-break properties (preferred vs acceptable breaks)
  * :blank page selector
  * some of what's currently in GCPM
  * [[http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2009Mar/0065.html|top-of-page margin collapsing control]]
  * ability to control total pages counter
  * ability to repeat table captions, change text slightly (add '(cont.)', etc)
  * ability to [[http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2008Nov/0280.html|wrap rows]]
  * ability to apply widows/orphans pagination controls to table rows in a table (vs lines in a paragraph)
  * add percentage to page-break-before(after) as conditional page break.  (See http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2009Apr/0039.html)
  * :front and :back page selectors (like :left and :right, but determined by writing order)
