  * Move closed issues (resolved issues which have edits completed in the draft) to
    * https://www.w3.org/wiki/CSS3-UI
  * Make spec edits for resolved issues, then move them to https://www.w3.org/wiki/CSS3-UI
    * edit /dvcs.w3.org/csswg/css-ui/Overview.bs
    * use https://api.csswg.org/bikeshed/ per [[https://wiki.csswg.org/tools/bikeshed#using-the-web-form|instructions]] to generate spec view HTML
    * “Save Page as…” “Web page, HTML only” Overview.html

  * For Tantek: process/do all of https://wiki.mozilla.org/Tantek-Mozilla-Projects#CSS3_UI tasks (including moving them here as issues if possible)

===== Current Issues =====

The following are known problems in/with the [[http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/CR-css3-ui-20040511/|11 May 2004 CSS3-UI Candidate Recommendation]].

==== Issue 35 ====
  ; Summary : Editorial: distinguishing public web sites from web applications is non obvious
  ; Raised by : Kang-Hao (Kenny) Lu <kennyluck@csail.mit.edu> 
  ; URL : http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2012Feb/0808.html
  ; URL : http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2014Dec/0072.html
  ; Proposed Resolution : 
  ; Status : blocked by [[#Issue 40]]



==== Issue 38 ====
  ; Summary : what to do if outline-offset is negative, especially to the point that the offset is more than half the element size or similar values that make it impossible to draw?
  ; Raised by : Kang-Hao (Kenny) Lu <kennyluck@csail.mit.edu> 
  ; URL : http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2012Feb/0601.html
  ; URL : http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2014Nov/0449.html
  ; URL : http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2014Dec/0033.html
  ; Proposed Resolution : "Specifying a negative values is allowed, and causes the outline to shrink into the border box. However, in order to make sure that the outline is always visible even with large negative values, neither the height nor the width of the shape drawn by the outline may become smaller than twice the computed value of the outline-width property. User Agents must apply this constraint separately in each dimension. If the outline is drawn as several shapes not connected with each other, this constraint applies to each shape separately." Justifications and variations in the mail linked to above
  ; Status : Pending group discussion on proposition



==== Issue 39 ====
  ; Summary : Various issues with ime-mode
  ; Raised by : Kang-Hao (Kenny) Lu <kennyluck@csail.mit.edu>
  ; URL : http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2012Feb/0759.html
  ; URL : http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2014Dec/0072.html
  ; Proposed Resolution : 
  ; Status : blocked by [[#Issue 40]]


==== Issue 40 ====
  ; Summary : ime-mode is windows specific and bad design, and should not be standardized. (has replacement suggestion)
  ; Raised by : Masayuki Nakano <masayuki@d-toybox.com> and James Craig <jcraig@apple.com> 
  ; URL : http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2012Feb/0959.html
  ; URL : http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2013May/0075.html
  ; URL : http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2014Dec/0072.html
  ; URL : http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2014Dec/0090.html
  ; Florian's Proposed resolution : drop ime-mode. It is not fully interoperable, and cannot become so cross platform. 
  ; Proposed Resolution : Document as obsoleted - since it is interoperably implemented (IE, FF) but undesirable for further propagation.
  ; Status : Pending group decision


==== Issue 47 ====
  ; Summary : The specced 'resize' proprety's behavior is *completely* different from the behavior implemented in browsers supporting the property
  ; Raised by : François Remy
  ; URL : http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2012Dec/0221.html
  ; URL : http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2014Dec/0063.html
  ; Resolution : allow behavior currently implemented by browsers and the one currently in the spec, amended to talk about a resize function instead of a resize factor
  ; Status : Resolved, but objections have been raised (see http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2014Dec/0177.html) 
  ; Proposed new Resolution : spec the interoperable behavior

==== Issue 48 ====
  ; Summary : description of cursor: auto insufficient and not interoperable
  ; Raised by : David Baron
  ; URL : http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2013Jan/0275.html
  ; URL : http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2014Nov/0531.html
  ; Proposed Resolution : restrict the auto value to handling things that cannot be described by the UA stylesheet. Detailed proposal to be made.
  ; Status : Pending proposal



==== Issue 50 ====
  ; Summary : add user-select back to css3-ui, it has 3 implementations
  ; Raised by : Tab Atkins and Edward O'Connor
  ; URL : http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2013Apr/0537.html

  ; URL : http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2014Nov/0536.html
  ; Proposed Resolution : Defer to level 4, there's too much interop to figure out
  ; Status : Pending group approval of proposition

  ; Summary : applying transforms to the outline is weird, especially in 3d
  ; Raised by : Florian Rivoal
  ; URL : http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2013Aug/0423.html
  ; URL : http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2014Dec/0134.html
  ; Proposed Resolution : Leave undefined for level 3
  ; Status : Blocked on [[#Issue 55]]


==== Issue 52 ====
  ; Summary : behaviour of resize on pseudos buggy and ambiguously defined
  ; Raised by : Lea Verou
  ; URL : http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2014Jul/0477.html
  ; Proposed Resolution : 
  ; Status : Blocked on [[#Issue 47]]

==== Issue 53 ====
  ; Summary : resize factor behaviour is weird when width / height are later dynamically modified
  ; Raised by : Lea Verou
  ; URL : http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2014Jul/0517.html
  ; URL : http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2014Dec/0063.html
  ; Proposed Resolution : 
  ; Status : Blocked on [[#Issue 47]]


==== Issue 54 ====
  ; Summary : Can text-overflow ellipsis not break in the middle of a word?
  ; Raised by : Stuart Langridge
  ; URL : https://twitter.com/sil/status/537627213789949952
  ; Proposed Resolution : Consider allowing implementation flexibility to ellipse at a text wrap opportunity instead of at a character boundary, and ask for further clarification (should this be automatic per implementation? or under author control)
  ; Status : Collected, need to write up a spec-text change proposal for group consideration.

==== Issue 55 ====
  ; Summary : Outline has a very loose definition, and significant interop problems. Should we tighten it up?
  ; Raised by : Florian Rivoal
  ; URL : http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2014Dec/0134.html
  ; Proposed Resolution : Leave undefined in level 3, try to converge somewhat in level 4
  ; Status : Pending group feedback


==== Issue 60 ====
  ; Summary : Information about when the resize factor gets reset is not sufficiently specific 
  ; Raised by : Boris Zbarsky
  ; URL : http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2004May/0222.html
  ; Proposed Resolution : 
  ; Status : Blocked by [[#Issue 47]]

  ; Summary : apply text-overflow even when overflow is visible?

  ; URL : http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2015Jan/0048.html
  ; Proposed Resolution : Apply text-overflow regardless of overflow, or consider reverting https://www.w3.org/wiki/CSS3-UI#Issue_32
  ; Status : Pending group feedback

  
==== Issue 69 ====
  ; Summary : box-sizing insufficiently specified for replaced elements
  ; Raised by : Boris Zbarsky
  ; URL : http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2011Jul/0232.html
  ; Proposed Resolution : Make adjustments to http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visudet.html#Computing_widths_and_margins and
http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visudet.html#Computing_heights_and_margins based on mail above
  ; Status : Pending group feedback


==== Issue 70 ====
  ; Summary : CSS3-UI defines the 'default object size' for cursors, but not the 'concrete object size'
  ; Raised by : Tab Atkins
  ; URL : http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2015Jan/0163.html
  ; Proposed Resolution : Add the following sentence: "The <a>concrete object size</a> is determined using the <a>default sizing algorithm</a>. If an operating system is <strong>incapable</strong> of rendering a cursor above a given size, cursors larger than that size must be shrunk to within the OS-supported size bounds, while maintaining the cursor image's intrinsic ratio, if any."

===== Rejected Issues =====

===== Issues Pending edits =====
The following issues need an edit to be applied to the spec. Most of them have a WG resolution, and those that don't are editorial/non-controversial and don't need a resolution.

* ... none currently ... more soon ....


====== FAQ ======
* Consider moving to https://www.w3.org/wiki/CSS3-UI/FAQ

===== text-overflow for non-latin scripts =====
Q: Many non latin scripts use something else than 3 dots for the same effect as an ellipsis. How does this work?

A: The current editor's draft allows implementations to use something other than 3 dots:

"Implementations may substitute a more language/script-appropriate ellipsis character."

from http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-ui/#text-overflow

===== text-overflow atomic inlines that would overlap the ellipsis =====

Q: What should an implementation do when an atomic inline element would overlap the ellipsis marker?

A: Remove it (the atomic inline element(s)) to make room for the ellipsis marker per the CSS3-UI spec (and Opera and IE9 appear to do this already).

====== css3-ui additional spec improvements ======
  * Consider adding clarifying examples in spec, adding tests. (per Issue 22)
