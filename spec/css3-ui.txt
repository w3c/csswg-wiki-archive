====== css3-ui faq ======

===== text-overflow for non-latin scripts =====
Q: Many non latin scripts use something else than 3 dots for the same effect as an ellipsis. How does this work?

A: The current editor's draft allows implementations to use something other than 3 dots:

"Implementations may substitute a more language/script-appropriate ellipsis character."

==== Issue 1 ====
  ; Summary : css3-ui should have a test suite
  ; Raised by : Tantek Çelik
  ; URL : eventually http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/#css3-ui
  ; Proposed Resolution : create at least one test case per feature, update "Current Issues" section above to add the text <code>See the [[http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/#css3-ui|released]] and 
  [[http://dev.w3.org/CSS/css3-ui-test-suite/src/|development]] versions 
  of the test suite for the "Tests" references.</code>
  ; Status : accepted and noted in editor's draft. pending contributions to test suite.


==== Issue 2 ====
  ; Summary : Change name/title of spec to be consistent with other CSS3 modules
  ; Raised by : Tantek Çelik
  ; URL : n/a
  ; Proposed Resolution : Change name/title of CSS3-ui from "CSS3 Basic User Interface Module" to "CSS Basic User Interface Module Level 3"
  ; Status : resolved in editor's draft. pending publication of public draft.

==== Issue 3 ====
  ; Summary : ::value needs to specify which properties are allowed on that pseudo-element
  ; Raised by : Tab Atkins
  ; URL : http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2010Mar/0158.html
  ; URL : http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-selectors/#first-line
  ; Proposed Resolution : specify the same properties (by listing them explicitly) that apply to ::first-line as applying to ::value: 'font-*', 'color', 'background-*', ‘word-spacing’, ‘letter-spacing’, ‘text-decoration’, ‘vertical-align’, ‘text-transform’, ‘line-height’. 
  ; Status : resolved in editor's draft. pending publication of public draft. 

==== Issue 4 ====
  ; Summary : computed value of 'pointer-events' vs initial value vs SVG vs CSS3-UI conflict. A quick test shows that IE9 and Opera return 'visiblePainted', while WebKit and Firefox return 'auto'.
  ; Raised by: Erik Dahlstrom
  ; URL : http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2010Sep/0818.html
  ; URL : https://wiki.mozilla.org/Tantek-Mozilla-projects#pointer-events
  ; Proposed Resolution : informative UA style sheet addition to explicitly set an SVG-specific value.
  ; Status : editors draft updated with style sheet additions, awaiting input from Jonathan Watt, implementer of pointer-events in Firefox.

==== Issue 5 ====
  ; Summary : In SVG 1.1 the 'pointer-events' property only applies to 'graphics elements', but in css3-ui it applies to all elements. Why? (Details raised by Kevin Ar18: "svg tag should not trigger pointer events like the SVG spec states and as noted here: http://www.w3.org/2010/09/27-fx-minutes.html#item03 Originally, the plan was to include this explanation in an SVG spec, but it was concluded that it should be in the CSS specs instead." )

  ; URL : http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2010Nov/0304.html
  ; URL : http://www.w3.org/2010/09/27-fx-minutes.html#item03
  ; Proposed Resolution : 1: Add whatever default style sheet rules are necessary to implement SVG's "applies only" special cases and then 2: add a new FAQ: Any element can be given dimensions with CSS and thus can potentially receive events. In general property dependence on specific elements or classes of elements (e.g. "graphics elements") is bad design (for specification of properties). Much better to simply say "applies to all" (especially for inherited properties) and then use default style sheet rules and/or a computed abstraction like "has dimension" or "has a geometry".
  ; Status : resolved in editor's draft, awaiting public draft. proposed - add a default style sheet rule for the 'svg' pointer-events:none for SVG spec compat, and then move the "pointer-events: visiblePainted" declaration to a new rule for 'svg>*' elements. add more rules as necessary to mimic SVG's notion of "applies to 'graphics elements'".

==== Issue 6 ====
  ; Summary : Normatively reference SVG 1.1 for 'fill' and 'stroke' property definitions.
  ; Raised by: Erik Dahlstrom
  ; URL : http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2010Sep/0818.html
  ; Proposed Resolution : inline links to SVG 1.1 property definitions
  ; Status : proposed - awaiting URLs

==== Issue 7 ====
  ; Summary :  The note about how 'fill' and 'stroke' don't affect the result for 'all' is missing (compare with the SVG 1.1 pointer-events definition. http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/interact.html#PointerEventsProperty
  ; Raised by: Erik Dahlstrom
  ; URL : http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2010Sep/0818.html
  ; Proposed Resolution : state how 'all' is applied in svg separately from how it's applied otherwise. The same also applies to all the other pointer-event values, where svg is mentioned in parenthesis.
  ; Status : proposed
  
==== Issue 8 ====
  ; Summary : pointer-events definition lacks many of the details from the SVG 1.1 specification http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/interact.html#PointerEventsProperty, e.g how 'clip-path' and 'mask' affects pointer-events, how text elements are handled etc.
  ; Raised by: Erik Dahlstrom
  ; URL : http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2010Sep/0818.html
  ; Proposed resolution : incorporate such details as necessary, as part of the goal here is not to not normatively depend on SVG 1.1 for the property definition itself.  This is similar to how CSS3 color incorporates and defines the full set of color keywords instead of normatively depending on SVG.
  ; Status : proposed
  
==== Issue 9 ====
  ; Summary : How opacity (and other forms of alpha, e.g rgba, fill-opacity, stroke-opacity etc) affects 'pointer-events' is undefined.  
  ; Raised by: Erik Dahlstrom
  ; URL : http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2010Sep/0818.html
  ; Proposed resolution : incorporate such details as necessary
  ; Status : proposed

==== Issue 11 ====
  ; Summary : multiple issues from Kevin Ar18 2010-11-17
  ; Raised by : Kevin Ar18
  ; URL : http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2010Nov/0257.html
  ; Proposed Resolution : itemize and split into multiple sub-issues here. some may be merely details on Issue 5.
  ; Status : collected.
  

==== Issue 12 ====
  ; Summary : what are effects of 'pointer-events' with regards to keyboard navigation?
  ; Raised by : Doug Schepers
  ; URL : http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-fx/2010OctDec/0106.html
  ; URL : http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-ui/#pointer-events
  ; Proposed resolution : informative note in the definition of the 'pointer-events' property would help steer authors to think about how they are using this (such as a suggestion that if pointer-events are turned off, authors should also consider making the element not 
focusable, as well).
  ; Status : resolved, informative note added to editor's draft. awaiting public draft.
  
==== Issue 13 ====
  ; Summary : should CSS3 UI (or some future version) incorporate a 'focusable' property (like in SVG)
  ; Raised by : Tantek Çelik
  ; URL : http://www.w3.org/TR/SVGTiny12/interact.html#focusable-attr

  ; Summary : How does text-overflow:ellipsis work with overflow-style: marquee-line? 
  ; Raised by : Andrew Fedoniouk
  ; URL : http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2008Dec/0109.html
  ; URL : http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/CR-css3-marquee-20081205/#marquee-style
  ; Proposed Resolution : ???. Since CSS3 Marquee is already in CR and text-overflow is the "new" feature, it is up to text-overflow to define the interaction.
  ; Status : Collected.

==== Issue 19 ====
  ; Summary : CSS3-UI should define 'overflow-x' and 'overflow-y' properties
  ; Raised by : David Hyatt / Tantek Çelik
  ; URL : http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2010Nov/0049.html
  ; URL : https://developer.mozilla.org/En/CSS/Overflow-x

  ; URL : http://www.w3.org/Style/Group/css2-src/visufx.html#overflow 
  ; URL : http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-marquee/#the-overflow-style
  ; Proposed Resolution : Define 'overflow-x' and 'overflow-y' properties in CSS3-UI as already interoperably implemented by various browsers. Pull in entirety of [[http://www.w3.org/Style/Group/css3-src/css3-box/#overflow|section 16 from CSS3 Box draft]]. Sync (incorporate) any updates/changes [[http://www.w3.org/Style/Group/css2-src/visufx.html#overflow|in CSS 2.1 overflow definition]]. Check that [[http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-marquee/#the-overflow-style|css3-marquee overflow-style]] implicitly deals with overflow-x and overflow-y correctly. Clarify: box-shadow should never trigger overflow/scrollbars. Clarify: do margins trigger overflow/scrollbars? Maybe they don't trigger overflow but if there is overflow anyways (something else triggers scrollbars), then margins influence the dimensions of the scrollable area. Consider: define baseline behavior as depending only on overflow-y per [[http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2010Nov/0049.html|Robert O'Callahan / David Hyatt emails]].
