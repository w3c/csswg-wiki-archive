  ; Raised by : Tantek Çelik
  ; URL : http://www.xanthir.com/etc/text-overflow.html
  ; URL : http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2009Nov/0219.html
  ; Proposed Resolution : Add horizontal scrolling text-overflow example akin to Tab's test case, note that it works in both Firefox and Opera (interop), but currently not in Webkit (Chrome, Safari).

==== Issue 25 ====

  ; URL : http://wiki.csswg.org/spec/css4-ui#nav-properties
  ; Proposed Resolution : drop nav-index property from CSS3-UI in next CR draft, move current text to a workspace page like I did for pointer-events: http://www.w3.org/wiki/User:Tantekelik#CSSWG , mark directional nav-* properties NOT at risk (note multiple implementations per http://www.w3.org/2013/11/27-css-irc )

====== FAQ ======
* Consider moving to https://www.w3.org/wiki/CSS3-UI/FAQ

===== text-overflow for non-latin scripts =====
Q: Many non latin scripts use something else than 3 dots for the same effect as an ellipsis. How does this work?

A: The current editor's draft allows implementations to use something other than 3 dots:

"Implementations may substitute a more language/script-appropriate ellipsis character."

from http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-ui/#text-overflow

===== text-overflow atomic inlines that would overlap the ellipsis =====

Q: What should an implementation do when an atomic inline element would overlap the ellipsis marker?

A: Remove it (the atomic inline element(s)) to make room for the ellipsis marker per the CSS3-UI spec (and Opera and IE9 appear to do this already).

====== css3-ui additional spec improvements ======

  * Consider adding clarifying examples in spec, adding tests. (per Issue 22)
