  * Move closed issues (resolved issues which have edits completed in the draft) to
    * https://www.w3.org/wiki/CSS3-UI
  * Make spec edits for resolved issues, then move them to https://www.w3.org/wiki/CSS3-UI
    * edit /dvcs.w3.org/csswg/css-ui/Overview.bs
    * use https://api.csswg.org/bikeshed/ per [[https://wiki.csswg.org/tools/bikeshed#using-the-web-form|instructions]] to generate spec view HTML
    * “Save Page as…” “Web page, HTML only” Overview.html

  * For Tantek: process/do all of https://wiki.mozilla.org/Tantek-Mozilla-Projects#CSS3_UI tasks (including moving them here as issues if possible)

===== Current Issues =====
The following are open issues in/with the [[http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/CR-css3-ui-20040511/|11 May 2004 CSS3-UI Candidate Recommendation]].

==== Issue 47 ====
  ; Summary : The specced 'resize' property's behavior is *completely* different from the behavior implemented in browsers supporting the property
  ; Raised by : François Remy
  ; URL : http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2012Dec/0221.html
  ; URL : http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2014Dec/0063.html
  ; Resolution : allow behavior currently implemented by browsers and the one currently in the spec, amended to talk about a resize function instead of a resize factor
  ; Proposed new Resolution : Note outstanding objection to "resize function" wording inline in the spec, link directly to email http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2014Dec/0177.html
  ; Status : Resolved and editor's draft updated noting objections have been raised (see http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2014Dec/0177.html). Leave issue open pending discussion regarding the objection with the working group.

==== Issue 48 ====
  ; Summary : description of cursor: auto insufficient and not interoperable
  ; Raised by : David Baron
  ; URL : http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2013Jan/0275.html
  ; URL : http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2014Nov/0531.html
  ; Proposed Resolution : Note this issue in spec explicitly with general plan to "restrict the auto value to handling things that cannot be described by the UA stylesheet. Detailed proposal to be made."
  ; Status : Issue noted inline in spec. Pending detailed proposal.

==== Issue 50 ====
  ; Summary : add user-select back to css3-ui, it has 3 implementations
  ; Raised by : Tab Atkins and Edward O'Connor
  ; URL : http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2013Apr/0537.html
  ; URL : http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2012Jul/0541.html
  ; URL : http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2014Nov/0536.html
  ; Proposed Resolution : Defer to level 4, there's too much interop to figure out. Edit spec status section (near at risk features) noting this as an outstanding issue - user-select is at risk of being added back.
  ; Status : Issue noted inline in spec. Pending group approval of postponement proposal.

==== Issue 51 ====
  ; Summary : applying transforms to the outline is weird, especially in 3d
  ; Raised by : Florian Rivoal
  ; URL : http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2013Aug/0423.html
  ; URL : http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2014Dec/0134.html
  ; Proposed Resolution : Leave undefined for level 3
  ; Status : Issue noted inline in spec. Pending group discussion.

==== Issue 52 ====
  ; Summary : behaviour of resize on pseudos buggy and ambiguously defined
  ; Raised by : Lea Verou
  ; URL : http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2014Jul/0477.html
  ; Proposed Resolution : Document in spec inline as known issue that browsers have bugs with resize
  ; Status : Issue noted inline in spec. Pending group discussion.

==== Issue 55 ====
  ; Summary : Outline has a very loose definition, and significant interop problems. Should we tighten it up?
  ; Raised by : Florian Rivoal
  ; URL : http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2014Dec/0134.html
  ; Proposed Resolution : Leave undefined in level 3, try to converge somewhat in level 4
  ; Status : Issue noted inline in spec. Pending group discussion.

==== Issue 68 ====
  ; Summary : apply text-overflow even when overflow is visible?
  ; Raised by : Mats Palmgren
  ; URL : http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2014Nov/0425.html
  ; URL : http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2015Jan/0048.html
  ; Proposed Resolution : Note as open issue, with possible resolutions of: Apply text-overflow regardless of overflow, or consider reverting https://www.w3.org/wiki/CSS3-UI#Issue_32
  ; Status : Issue noted inline in spec. Pending group discussion.

==== Issue 69 ====
  ; Summary : box-sizing insufficiently specified for replaced elements
  ; Raised by : Boris Zbarsky
  ; URL : http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2011Jul/0232.html
  ; Proposed Resolution : Note open issue inline in spec, with proposal: Make adjustments to http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visudet.html#Computing_widths_and_margins and
http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visudet.html#Computing_heights_and_margins based on mail above
  ; Status : Issue noted inline in spec. Pending group discussion and proposed text to patch CSS2.1 algorithms.


==== Issue 71 ====
  ; Summary : WG resolved to drop all pseudo elements from CSS-UI, but ::value and ::choices were retained, as they may apply to HTML in addition to XForms as they were initially specified for. However, they are not implemented anywhere, and it is not clear that they effectively solve the problem they were introduced for.
  ; Raised by : Floria Rivoal
  ; URL : https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2014Nov/0401.html
  ; URL : https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2015Jan/0046.html
  ; URL : https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2015Jan/0280.html
  ; Proposed Resolution : Drop ::value and ::choices
  ; Status : Pending group discussion



==== Issue 72 ====
  ; Summary : All browsers should be treated equally with regards to obsoleting the 'ime-mode' property, instead of saying "must not add support" for those that don't have it but "should drop support" for those that do.
  ; Raised by : Rossen Atanassov
  ; URL : http://www.w3.org/mid/CADhPm3uJkugzOcz-vaKXkFMGik=R2AXwxLmXaFtUj3E_HRnsyA@mail.gmail.com
  ; Proposed Resolution : Replace "Implementations must not add support for the ime-mode property. Implementations should drop support for it as soon as possible." with "User Agents should not support the ime-mode property".
  ; Status : Pending edit
  ; Pending Since : 2015/01/28

==== Issue 73 ====
  ; Summary : Support for negative outline-offset is marked as optional and at-risk. However, all browsers that support outline-offset support negative values. The only issue was the lack of interop for large negative values. The new spec prose introduced to define interoperable behavior is fine.
  ; Raised by : Florian Rivoal
  ; URL : http://www.w3.org/mid/CADhPm3uJkugzOcz-vaKXkFMGik=R2AXwxLmXaFtUj3E_HRnsyA@mail.gmail.com
  ; Proposed Resolution : Remove "UAs may ignore negative values. UAs that support " and mentions of "at risk". To deal with the risk of non implementation of the interoperable behavior in the CR time frame, replace "Neither the height nor the width [...] may be" by "Neither the height nor the width [...] should be", or do an similar rephrasing making this behavior optional (but not negative values altogether).
  ; Status : pending edit
  ; Pending Since : 2015/01/28

==== Issue 74 ====
  ; Summary : The phrasing of what happens with large negative values in the outline-offset property is unclear, and makes it sound like we should keep a blank space of outline-width * 2 inside the outline at minimum.
  ; Raised by : Fantasai
  ; URL : https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2015Jan/0581.html
  ; Proposed Resolution : Clarify that outline-width * 2 is the outside dimension of the shape
  ; Status : Pending edit


==== Issue 75 ====
  ; Summary : As we mark ime-mode as obsolete, we should point readers of the spec to the alternative ways to address the issue that ime-mode was attempting to solve.
  ; Raised by : Florian Rivoal
  ; URL : http://logs.csswg.org/irc.w3.org/css/2015-01-28/#e513809
  ; Proposed Resolution : Add a note to ime-mode pointing readers to relevant html attributes, and explaining that dropping ime-mode was because it was a bad solution, not because the problem isn't worth addressing. Draft phrasing: "<p>The Working Group recognizes the importance of presenting the most relevant text input UI to users depending on what type of input is expected from them. However, instead of trying to control directly the UI as ime-mode attempts to do, a better approach is to give as much context as possible to the User Agent, and let it present the best UI possible to the user out of the various possibilities available on the platform. In HTML, the following attributes are relevant: <ul><li>the lang attribute https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/dom.html#the-lang-and-xml:lang-attributes <li>the type attribute of the input element https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/forms.html#states-of-the-type-attribute
 <li>The inputmode attribute https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/forms.html#attr-fe-inputmode
<li>the pattern attribute of the input element https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/forms.html#the-pattern-attribute"
  ; Status : edit pending

==== Issue 76 ====
  ; Summary : the change introduced to address [[#Issue 54]] causes problems with bidi, scrolling, and is not necessarily an improvement anyway
  ; Raised by : Florian Rivoal
  ; URL : 
  ; Proposed Resolution : revert the change. If not, at least clarify the bidi situation.
  ; Status : pending group discussion

  ; Status : 

===== Rejected Issues =====
* None currently.

===== Issues Pending edits =====
The following issues need an edit to be applied to the spec. Most of them have a WG resolution, and those that don't are editorial/non-controversial and don't need a resolution.

* None currently.

===== Issues Pending dependent edits =====
Issues that are resolved, and require no specific edits, but are depending on edits for another issue to be completed.

* None currently.

====== FAQ ======
* Consider moving to https://www.w3.org/wiki/CSS3-UI/FAQ

===== text-overflow for non-latin scripts =====
Q: Many non latin scripts use something else than 3 dots for the same effect as an ellipsis. How does this work?

A: The current editor's draft allows implementations to use something other than 3 dots:

"Implementations may substitute a more language/script-appropriate ellipsis character."

from http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-ui/#text-overflow

===== text-overflow atomic inlines that would overlap the ellipsis =====
Q: What should an implementation do when an atomic inline element would overlap the ellipsis marker?

A: Remove it (the atomic inline element(s)) to make room for the ellipsis marker per the CSS3-UI spec (and Opera and IE9 appear to do this already).

====== css3-ui additional spec improvements ======
  * Consider adding clarifying examples in spec, adding tests. (per Issue 22)

====== Resolved Issues ======
