==== Issue 1 ====
  ; Summary : css3-ui should have a test suite
  ; Raised by : Tantek Çelik
  ; URL : eventually http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/#css3-ui
  ; Proposed Resolution : create at least one test case per feature, update "Current Issues" section above to add the text "<nowiki>See the [[http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/#css3-ui|released]] and [[http://dev.w3.org/CSS/css3-ui-test-suite/src/|development]] versions of the test suite for the "Tests" references.</nowiki>"

==== Issue 2 ====

  ; Summary : Change name/title of spec to be consistent with other CSS3 modules
  ; Raised by : Tantek Çelik
  ; URL : n/a
  ; Proposed Resolution : Change name/title of CSS3-ui from "CSS3 Basic User Interface Module" to "CSS Basic User Interface Module Level 3"
  ; Status : editorial, pending

==== Issue 3 ====

  ; Summary : ::value needs to specify which properties are allowed on that pseudo-element
  ; Raised by : Tab Atkins
  ; URL : http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2010Mar/0158.html
  ; Proposed Resolution : specify the same properties (by listing them explicitly) that apply to ::first-line as applying to ::value: 'font-*', 'color', 'background-*', ‘word-spacing’, ‘letter-spacing’, ‘text-decoration’, ‘vertical-align’, ‘text-transform’, ‘line-height’. 
  ; Status : proposed 

==== Issue 4 ====
  ; Summary : computed value of 'pointer-events' vs initial value vs SVG vs CSS3-UI conflict. A quick test shows that IE9 and Opera return 'visiblePainted', while webkit and firefox return 'auto'.
  ; Raised by: Erik Dahlstrom
  ; URL : http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2010Sep/0818.html
  ; Proposed Resolution : informative SVG UA style sheet to explicitly set an SVG-specific value.
  ; Status : proposed

==== Issue 5 ====
  ; Summary : In SVG 1.1 the 'pointer-events' property only applies to 'graphics elements', but in css3-ui it applies to all elements. Why? (Details raised by Kevin Ar18: "svg tag should not trigger pointer events like the SVG spec states and as noted here: http://www.w3.org/2010/09/27-fx-minutes.html#item03 Originally, the plan was to include this explanation in an SVG spec, but it was concluded that it should be in the CSS specs instead." )

  ; URL : http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2010Nov/0268.html
  ; URL : http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2010Nov/0304.html
  ; URL : http://www.w3.org/2010/09/27-fx-minutes.html#item03
  ; Proposed Resolution : New FAQ. Any element can be given dimensions with CSS and thus can potentially receive events.
  ; Status : proposed

==== Issue 6 ====
  ; Summary : Normatively reference SVG 1.1 for 'fill' and 'stroke' property definitions.
  ; Raised by: Erik Dahlstrom
  ; URL : http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2010Sep/0818.html
  ; Proposed Resolution : inline links to SVG 1.1 property definitions
  ; Status : proposed - awaiting URLs

==== Issue 7 ====
  ; Summary :  The note about how 'fill' and 'stroke' don't affect the result for 'all' is missing (compare with the SVG 1.1 pointer-events definition. http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/interact.html#PointerEventsProperty
  ; Raised by: Erik Dahlstrom
  ; URL : http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2010Sep/0818.html
  ; Proposed Resolution : state how 'all' is applied in svg separately from how it's applied otherwise. The same also applies to all the other pointer-event values, where svg is mentioned in parenthesis.
  ; Status : proposed
  
==== Issue 8 ====
  ; Summary : pointer-events definition lacks many of the details from the SVG 1.1 specification http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/interact.html#PointerEventsProperty, e.g how 'clip-path' and 'mask' affects pointer-events, how text elements are handled etc.
  ; Raised by: Erik Dahlstrom
  ; URL : http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2010Sep/0818.html
  ; Proposed resolution : incorporate such details as necessary, as part of the goal here is not to not normatively depend on SVG 1.1 for the property definition itself.  This is similar to how CSS3 color incorporates and defines the full set of color keywords instead of normatively depending on SVG.
  ; Status : proposed
  
==== Issue 9 ====
  ; Summary : How opacity (and other forms of alpha, e.g rgba, fill-opacity, stroke-opacity etc) affects 'pointer-events' is undefined.  
  ; Raised by: Erik Dahlstrom
  ; URL : http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2010Sep/0818.html
  ; Proposed resolution : incorporate such details as necessary
  ; Status : proposed
  
==== Issue 10 ====
  ; Summary : How 'clip-path', 'mask' and 'filter' affect 'pointer-events' is undefined.  
  ; Raised by: Erik Dahlstrom
  ; URL : http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2010Sep/0818.html
  ; Proposed resolution : incorporate such details as necessary
  ; Status : proposed


==== Issue 11 ====
  ; Summary : multiple issues from Kevin Ar18 2010-11-17
  ; Raised by : Kevin Ar18
  ; URL : http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2010Nov/0257.html
  ; Proposed Resolution : itemize and split into multiple sub-issues here. some may be merely details on Issue 5.
  ; Status : collected.
  

==== Issue 12 ====
  ; Summary: what are effects of 'pointer-events' with regards to keyboard navigation?
  ; Raised by : Doug Schepers
  ; URL : http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-fx/2010OctDec/0106.html
  ; URL : http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-ui/#pointer-events
  ; Proposed resolution : informative note in the definition of the 'pointer-events' property would help steer authors to think about how they are using this (such as a suggestion that if pointer-events are turned off, authors should also consider making the element not 
focusable, as well).
  ; Status: collected.
  
==== Issue 13 ====
  ; Summary: should CSS3 UI (or some future version) incorporate a 'focusable' property (like in SVG)
  ; Raised by : Tantek Çelik
  ; URL : http://www.w3.org/TR/SVGTiny12/interact.html#focusable-attr
  ; Proposed resolution : postpone til CSS4-UI.
  ; Status: collected.
