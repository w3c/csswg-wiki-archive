===== Work Mode =====
This issues page is key to the work mode of CSS3-UI. Here are next steps in rough order:
  * Move closed issues (resolved issues which have edits completed in the draft) to
    * https://www.w3.org/wiki/CSS3-UI
  * Make spec edits for resolved issues, then move them to https://www.w3.org/wiki/CSS3-UI
  * Collect new issues from www-style emails e.g.
    * Continue until www-style "[CSS3-UI]" "[CSS-UI]" emails since last draft have been processed.
  * For Tantek: process/do all of https://wiki.mozilla.org/Tantek-Mozilla-Projects#CSS3_UI tasks (including moving them here as issues if possible)

===== Current Issues =====

The following are known problems in/with the [[http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/CR-css3-ui-20040511/|11 May 2004 CSS3-UI Candidate Recommendation]].

==== Issue 24 ====
  ; Summary : Provide horizontal scrolling text-overflow example revealing more text that is elided 
  ; Raised by : Tantek Çelik
  ; URL : http://www.xanthir.com/etc/text-overflow.html
  ; URL : http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2009Nov/0219.html
  ; Proposed Resolution : Add horizontal scrolling text-overflow example akin to Tab's test case, note that it works in both Firefox and Opera (interop), but currently not in Webkit (Chrome, Safari). 
  ; Status : Resolved. Need to edit editor's draft.

==== Issue 25 ====
  ; Summary : nav-index property is not well implemented, nor expected to be. also, is problematic (per similar issues on tabindex in HTML). 
  ; Raised by : Tantek Çelik
  ; URL : here's one: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2012Oct/thread.html#msg468
  ; URL : http://wiki.csswg.org/spec/css4-ui#nav-properties
  ; URL : http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2011Nov/0712.html
  ; URL : https://wiki.csswg.org/ideas/nav-index
  ; URL : http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2011Nov/thread.html#msg440 (continues following month)
  ; URL : http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2011Nov/thread.html#msg441 (continues following month)
  ; Proposed Resolution : drop nav-index property from CSS3-UI in next CR draft, move current text to a workspace page like I did for pointer-events: http://www.w3.org/wiki/User:Tantekelik#CSSWG , mark directional nav-* properties NOT at risk (note multiple implementations per http://www.w3.org/2013/11/27-css-irc )
  ; Status : Need to edit editor's draft.

==== Issue 27 ====
  ; Summary : specify that 'cursor' propagates from the root to the viewport
  ; Raised by : Tab Atkins
  ; URL : http://krijnhoetmer.nl/irc-logs/whatwg/20130523#l-684
  ; URL : http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2013May/0301.html
  ; Proposed Resolution : Edit definition of 'cursor' to state (similar to how 'background' does [[http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-backgrounds/#special-backgrounds|in CSS3 Backgrounds]]) that it propagates from the root element to the viewport. Proposed text: "Since no element corresponds to the canvas, in order to allow styling of the canvas CSS, propagates the cursor of the root element (or, in the case of HTML, the <body> element). However, if no boxes are generated for the element whose cursor would be used for the canvas (for example, if the root element has ‘display: none’), then the canvas cursor is auto."
  ; Status : Resolved. Need to edit editor's draft

==== Issue 31 ====
  ; Summary : add 'caret-color' property at risk to css3-ui
  ; Raised by : Andrey Rybka (Bloomberg) <arybka@bloomberg.net>
  ; URL : Resolved http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2014Oct/0260.html
  ; URL : Initial proposal http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2011Nov/0772.html
  ; URL : 'auto' keyword computing to currentColor http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2014Aug/0236.html
  ; URL : Gecko intent https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1063162
  ; URL : caret-* proposals http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2014Sep/0172.html
  ; Proposed Resolution : add 'caret-color' property with values color | 'auto', where 'auto' should compute to currentColor, mark entire feature at risk. Add 'caret' shorthand and other 'caret-*' properties to a feature proposal for CSS4-UI.
  ; Status : Resolved. Need to edit editor's draft.

====== FAQ ======
* Consider moving to https://www.w3.org/wiki/CSS3-UI/FAQ

===== text-overflow for non-latin scripts =====
Q: Many non latin scripts use something else than 3 dots for the same effect as an ellipsis. How does this work?

A: The current editor's draft allows implementations to use something other than 3 dots:

"Implementations may substitute a more language/script-appropriate ellipsis character."

from http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-ui/#text-overflow

===== text-overflow atomic inlines that would overlap the ellipsis =====

Q: What should an implementation do when an atomic inline element would overlap the ellipsis marker?

A: Remove it (the atomic inline element(s)) to make room for the ellipsis marker per the CSS3-UI spec (and Opera and IE9 appear to do this already).

====== css3-ui additional spec improvements ======
  * Consider adding clarifying examples in spec, adding tests. (per Issue 22)
