==== Issue 21 ====
  ; Summary : text-overflow definition must include <string> value and 2 values option, but with both explicitly at-risk.
  ; Raised by : CSS WG
  ; URL : http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-ui/#text-overflow0
  ; URL : http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2011Jun/0329.html
  ; Proposed Resolution : Update text-overflow definition to include <string> value and {1,2} values option as described below.
  ; Status : Resolved. Editor's draft edited accordingly. Awaiting public draft.

=== text-overflow string ===
text-overflow: <string>. consider incorporating dropped <string> value. 

Originally text-overflow: <string> was [[http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/CR-css3-text-20030514/#text-overflow-ellipsis|defined in CSS3 Text CR 2003-05-14]] - but no one implemented it. Thus any request for including this MUST include some justification as to why/how implementations would consider it differently than they did (and reject) for CSS3 Text CR 2003.

Real-world use-cases:
  * none.

Theoretical use-cases:
  * text-overflow:"" can be used to clip inline content on whole characters (grapheme clusters) / atomic elements rather than clipping them at a pixel boundary. (is there any evidence of designers wanting such an effect?)
  * multilingual (need specific examples here. which languages and which characters?)
  * author might wish to use "(...)" for instance in citations (need a reference to this style of ellipsing in citations)
  * vertical ellipsis in maths (need a reference to this style of ellipsing in math)
  * a line that has nothing but images on it. Having two markers also motivates having a <string> value to be able to specify different symbols on each side.

CSSWG resolution: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2011Jun/0329.html - in particular:
  * syntax: "RESOLVED: Add the two-value syntax to text-overflow in css3-ui, marked at-risk"
  * semantic: "two strings (left and right) in addition to one string (both)."
  * unprefixed: "[FF is] implementing it unprefixed, because everyone else already has."

Possible spec markup:

<code>
<td>( clip | ellipsis | 
   <a class="noxref" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/syndata.html#value-def-string">
     <span class="value-inst-string">&lt;string&gt;</span></a> ){1,2}
</td>
...
      <dt><dfn title="text-overflow:&lt;string&gt;">
           <var>&lt;string&gt;</var></dfn></dt>
        <dd>
        Render the given string to represent clipped text. 
        The string is treated as an independent paragraph for bidi purposes.
        </dd>
...
<p>
[At risk]. If there is one value, use it for both the left and right line edges. 
If there are two values, use the first value for the right edge, 
and the second value for the left edge.
</p>
</code>



==== Issue 24 ====
  ; Summary : Provide horizontal scrolling text-overflow example revealing more text that is elided 
  ; Raised by : Tantek Çelik
  ; URL : http://www.xanthir.com/etc/text-overflow.html
  ; URL : http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2009Nov/0219.html
  ; Proposed Resolution : Add horizontal scrolling text-overflow example akin to Tab's test case, note that it works in both Firefox and Opera (interop), but currently not in Webkit (Chrome, Safari). 
  ; Status : Resolved. Need to edit editor's draft.

==== Issue 25 ====
  ; Summary : nav-index property is not well implemented, nor expected to be. also, is problematic (per similar issues on tabindex in HTML). 
  ; Raised by : Tantek Çelik
  ; URL : here's one: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2012Oct/thread.html#msg468
  ; URL : http://wiki.csswg.org/spec/css4-ui#nav-properties
  ; Proposed Resolution : drop nav-index property from CSS3-UI in next CR draft, move current text to a workspace page like I did for pointer-events: http://www.w3.org/wiki/User:Tantekelik#CSSWG , mark directional nav-* properties NOT at risk (note multiple implementations per http://www.w3.org/2013/11/27-css-irc )
  ; Status : Need to edit editor's draft.

==== Issue 26 ====
  ; Summary : add 'cursor' values 'grab' and 'grabbing' per existing interop prefixed support by Gecko and WebKit
  ; Raised by : Frank Yan / Tantek Çelik
  ; URL : http://frankyan.com/labs/cursor/
  ; URL : http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2013Apr/0058.html

  ; URL : http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2013May/0301.html
  ; Proposed Resolution : Edit definition of 'cursor' to state (similar to how 'background' does in CSS3 Backgrounds) that it propagates from the root element to the viewport.
  ; Status : Resolved. Need to edit editor's draft

==== Issue 28 ====
  ; Summary : link to nav-* directional navigation tests from nav-* section, and in tests section in header
  ; Raised by : Tantek Çelik

  ; URL : http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2013Nov/0271.html
  ; URL : https://github.com/w3c/csswg-test/pull/372

  ; Status : Resolved. Need to edit editor's draft

==== Issue 29 ====
  ; Summary : nav-* directional navigation properties definition prose fixes
  ; Raised by : Simon Sapin
  ; URL : http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2013Oct/0102.html

==== Issue 30 ====
  ; Summary : Re-add ::selection, define according to existing impl interop of ::selection 
  ; Raised by : Tantek Çelik
  ; URL : http://www.w3.org/2013/12/11-css-irc#T18-01-59 (recent IRC discussion)
  ; URL : http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2008Oct/0268.html (list of questions/issues with ::selection)
  ; URL : https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::selection (documentation of current support)
  ; URL : http://www.w3.org/TR/2005/WD-css3-selectors-20051215/#UIfragments (most recent spec text)
  ; URL : http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/CR-css3-ui-20040511/ (most recent CR reference)
  ; URL : http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/CR-css3-selectors-20011113/#UIfragments (most recent CR spec text)
  ; URL : http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2013Dec/0240.html (email about this proposal)
  ; Proposed Resolution : 
    - Create tests to answer questions raised in http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2008Oct/0268.html
    - Run tests in browsers: Chrome, Firefox (as ::-moz-selection), IE9+, Opera, Safari
    - For all tests, if a majority of browsers agree on a test, codify that behavior into spec text. If not, explicitly list that test's behavior as undefined (browsers known to disagree)
    - Add resulting spec text to a new ::selection section in CSS3-UI.
    - Submit to CSS test-suite efforts each test where a majority of browsers agree on behavior.

  ; Historical note : ::selection introduced as :selection 1999-09-16: http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/WD-css3-userint-19990916#pseudo-selection
  ; Status : Proposed resolution. Awaiting WG consensus (or absent objection), then need to perform above steps (create tests, run tests, spec majority behaviors, submit those tests).

==== Issue n ====
  ; Summary : 
  ; Raised by : Tantek Çelik
  ; URL : 
  ; Proposed Resolution : 
  ; Status : 

====== FAQ ======
* Consider moving to https://www.w3.org/wiki/CSS3-UI/FAQ

===== text-overflow for non-latin scripts =====
Q: Many non latin scripts use something else than 3 dots for the same effect as an ellipsis. How does this work?

A: The current editor's draft allows implementations to use something other than 3 dots:

"Implementations may substitute a more language/script-appropriate ellipsis character."

from http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-ui/#text-overflow

===== text-overflow atomic inlines that would overlap the ellipsis =====

Q: What should an implementation do when an atomic inline element would overlap the ellipsis marker?

A: Remove it (the atomic inline element(s)) to make room for the ellipsis marker per the CSS3-UI spec (and Opera and IE9 appear to do this already).

====== css3-ui additional spec improvements ======

  * Consider adding clarifying examples in spec, adding tests. (per Issue 22)
