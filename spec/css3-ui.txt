===== Work Mode =====
This issues page is key to the work mode of CSS3-UI. Here are next steps in rough order:
  * Move closed issues (resolved issues which have edits completed in the draft) to
    * https://www.w3.org/wiki/CSS3-UI
  * Make spec edits for resolved issues, then move them to https://www.w3.org/wiki/CSS3-UI
    * edit /dvcs.w3.org/csswg/css-ui/Overview.bs
    * use https://api.csswg.org/bikeshed/ per [[https://wiki.csswg.org/tools/bikeshed#using-the-web-form|instructions]] to generate spec view HTML
    * “Save Page as…” “Web page, HTML only” Overview.html

  * For Tantek: process/do all of https://wiki.mozilla.org/Tantek-Mozilla-Projects#CSS3_UI tasks (including moving them here as issues if possible)

===== Rejected Issues =====

===== Issues Pending edits =====
The following issues need an edit to be applied to the spec. Most of them have a WG resolution, and those that don't are editorial/non-controversial and don't need a resolution.

==== Issue: 45 ====
  ; Summary : include an example highlighting the <target> part of the nav-* syntax. Suggestion: nav-up: #foo "bar"
  ; Raised by : Yves Lafon
  ; URL : http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2012Oct/0499.html
  ; Proposed Resolution : see patch in http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2014Nov/0497.html
  ; Status : Pending edit

  ; Summary : what happens if <x> and <y> are out of bounds for the cursor property
  ; Raised by : Kang-Hao (Kenny) Lu  and Tab Atkins

  ; URL : http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2014Nov/0501.html
  ; Resolution : Clamp, independently. Proposed phrasing: "If the coordinates of the hotspot, as specified either inside the image resource or by <x> and <y> values fall outside of the cursor image, they must be clamped (independently) to fit."
  ; Status : Resolved, pending edit




==== Issue 56 ====
  ; Summary : WG resolved to make outline corners rounded to match borders, but it was only lightly discussed, and not obvious how that should work
  ; Raised by : Florian Rivoal
  ; URL : http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2014Dec/0145.html
  ; Resolution : Add "To the extent that the outline follows the border edge, it should follow the border-radius curve" to level 3
  ; Status : Resolved, pending edit


==== Issue 57 ====
  ; Summary : the default object size for cursors is defined in CSS2.1, but not in CSS3-UI, which replaces it
  ; Raised by : Tab Atkins
  ; URL : http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2010Dec/0080.html
  ; Proposed Resolution : Add the following sentence to CSS3-UI's cursor section, under the <uri> value explanation: "The <a>default object size</a> for cursor images is a UA-defined size that should be based on the size of a typical cursor on the UA's operating system."
  ; Status : pending edit.


==== Issue 58 ====
  ; Summary : border box is a well defined term. Let's use it.
  ; Raised by : Fantasai
  ; URL : http://www.w3.org/mid/4BF38810.2060005@inkedblade.net

  ; Status : pending edit


==== Issue 63 ====
  ; Summary : Section "Dependencies on other modules" is redundant with bibliography, but normative "Module interactions" section defining what the spec replaces is missing
  ; Raised by : Florian
  ; URL : http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2014Nov/0433.html
  ; Proposed Resolution : replace “Dependencies on other modules” with “Module Interactions”. Patch attached in mail above.

====== FAQ ======
* Consider moving to https://www.w3.org/wiki/CSS3-UI/FAQ

===== text-overflow for non-latin scripts =====
Q: Many non latin scripts use something else than 3 dots for the same effect as an ellipsis. How does this work?

A: The current editor's draft allows implementations to use something other than 3 dots:

"Implementations may substitute a more language/script-appropriate ellipsis character."

from http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-ui/#text-overflow

===== text-overflow atomic inlines that would overlap the ellipsis =====

Q: What should an implementation do when an atomic inline element would overlap the ellipsis marker?

A: Remove it (the atomic inline element(s)) to make room for the ellipsis marker per the CSS3-UI spec (and Opera and IE9 appear to do this already).

====== css3-ui additional spec improvements ======
  * Consider adding clarifying examples in spec, adding tests. (per Issue 22)
