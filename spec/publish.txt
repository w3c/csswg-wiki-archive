====== Step-by-step Publishing a CSS Spec ======

  - **Summarize Changes -** Make a Changes section summarizing the major changes since the last publication. ("Major" is relative---for a CR, it's any non-editorial change, but for an early-stage WD it would be sections that got an overhaul, major syntactic changes, or major behavioral changes, not every minor detail that got fixed.) This will help reviewers focus their review.
  - **CSSWG Resolution -** Get an official CSSWG Resolution to publish. Make any changes requested.
    - **LCWD comment period -** For LCWD, establish with the WG a deadline (3 weeks minimum, 4 is typical) and a list of other WGs to ask for comments. Let a chair or staff contact inform those WGs, and all other WGs (via chairs@w3.org) of the upcoming last call and give them a few days to ask for a different deadline.
  - **Prepare Draft -**
    - Update the Previous Version link at the top to the latest dated URL on /TR (Omit or write "none" if there is none)
    - [[http://validator.w3.org/|Validate]] both Overview.src.html and Overview.html
    - [[http://validator.w3.org/checklink|Link-check]] your spec.
    - Optional: If you feel so inclined, you can use [[http://www.w3.org/2005/07/pubrules|pubrules checker]] (if it's working), review its results, and correct any errors. (Some errors are expected/harmless if you check an editor's draft, so read carefully!)
  - **Request Publication -** Send a message to Bert, CCing w3c-css-wg, asking him to put your spec in the publication pipeline. Include a link to the minutes with the resolution to publish. (If Bert is on vacation, ask fantasai or Chris.) Put ''[Publish]'' in the subject line.
    - **FPWD permission -** For FPWD, a chair (Daniel or Peter) or staff contact (Bert or Chris) needs to ask a W3C domain leader to approve a the publication and the choice of URL.
  - **Wait for Publication -** Wait for the spec to be published. W3C publishes on Tuesdays and Thursdays. (Assume Bert needs 2 days notice before the publication date unless he tells you otherwise.)
  - **Announce Your Spec -** Post an announcement of your new spec to [[mailto:www-style@w3.org|www-style]] and the [[https://www.w3.org/blog/CSS/wp-admin/|CSSWG Blog]] and link it from [[http://twitter.com/csswg|@csswg]]. If you need help with this, ask fantasai. A good announcement includes:
     * A link to the spec
     * An explanation of what's new, what's cool, what's changed, maybe what to expect going forward, but most importantly what you would especially like feedback on.
     * Instructions for sending feedback
    The CSSWG blog is your communication channel to people who aren't technical enough or devoted enough to follow www-style. Take advantage of it, and engage your audience.

Note: The above combines steps specific to the CSS WG and general W3C-wide [[http://services.w3.org/xslt?xmlfile=http://www.w3.org/2005/08/01-transitions.html&xslfile=http://www.w3.org/2005/08/transitions.xsl|publication rules.]] See the latter also for steps to publishing a Note, CR, PR, etc.
