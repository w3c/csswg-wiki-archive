====== Step-by-step Publishing a CSS Spec ======

  - Make a Changes section summarizing the major changes since the last publication. ("Major" is relative---for a CR, it's any non-editorial change, but for an early-stage WD it would be sections that got an overhaul, major syntactic changes, or major behavioral changes, not every minor detail that got fixed.)
  - Get an official CSSWG Resolution to publish. Make any changes requested.
  - **Only if 1st WD ("FPWD"):** A chair (Daniel or Peter) or staff contact (Bert or Chris) needs to ask a W3C domain leader to approve the publication and the choice of URL.
  - **Only if last call ("LCWD"):** Establish with the WG a deadline (3 weeks minimum, 4 is typical) and a list of other WGs to ask for comments. Let a chair or staff contact inform those WGs, and all other WGs (via chairs@w3.org) of the upcoming last call and give them a few days to ask for a different deadline.
  - Update the Previous Version link at the top to the latest dated URL on /TR (Omit or write "none" if there is none)
  - [[http://validator.w3.org/|Validate]] both Overview.src.html and Overview.html
  - [[http://validator.w3.org/checklink|Link-check]] your spec.
  - Run [[http://www.w3.org/2005/07/pubrules|pubrules checker]] (if it's working), review its results, and correct any errors. (Some errors are expected/harmless if you check an editor's draft, so read carefully!)
  - Send Bert a message asking him to put your spec in the publication pipeline. Include a link to the minutes with the resolution to publish. (If Bert is on vacation, ask fantasai or Chris.)
  - Wait for the spec to be published. W3C publishes on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
  - Post an announcement of your new spec to [[http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/|www-style]] and the [[http://www.w3.org/blog/CSS|CSSWG Blog]] and link it from [[http://twitter.com/csswg|@csswg]]. A good announcement includes:
     * A link to the spec
     * An explanation of what's new, what's cool, what's changed, maybe what to expect going forward, but most importantly what you would especially like feedback on.
     * Instructions for sending feedback
    The CSSWG blog is your communication channel to people who aren't technical enough or devoted enough to follow www-style. Take advantage of it, and engage your audience.

Note: The above combines steps specific to the CSS WG and general W3C-wide [[http://services.w3.org/xslt?xmlfile=http://www.w3.org/2005/08/01-transitions.html&xslfile=http://www.w3.org/2005/08/transitions.xsl|publication rules.]] See the latter also for steps to publishing a Note, CR, PR, etc.
