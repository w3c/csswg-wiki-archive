====== Step-by-step Publishing a CSS Spec ======

Note! There have been changes to the module template since it was written! Check the [[http://wiki.csswg.org/spec/format-update|meta-update list]].

  - **Summarize Changes -** Make a Changes section summarizing the major changes since the last publication. ("Major" is relative---for a CR, it's any non-editorial change, but for an early-stage WD it would be sections that got an overhaul, major syntactic changes, or major behavioral changes, not every minor detail that got fixed.) This will help reviewers focus their review.
  - **CSSWG Resolution -** Get an official CSSWG Resolution to publish. Make any changes requested.
    - **For LCWD**, establish with the WG a deadline (3 weeks minimum, 4 is typical) and a list of other WGs to ask for comments. Let a chair or staff contact inform those WGs, and all other WGs (via chairs@w3.org) of the upcoming last call and give them a few days to ask for a different deadline.
  - **Prepare Draft -**
    - Update the Previous Version link at the top to the latest dated URL on /TR (Omit or write "none" if there is none)
    - [[http://validator.w3.org/|Validate]] Overview.html
    - [[http://www.w3.org/2009/07/webidl-check|WebIDL check]] Overview.html
    - [[http://validator.w3.org/checklink|Link-check]] your spec.
    - run a spellchecker on your spec
    - Optional: If you feel so inclined, you can use [[http://www.w3.org/2005/07/pubrules|pubrules checker]] (if it's working), review its results, and correct any errors. (Some errors are expected/harmless if you check an editor's draft, so read carefully!)  (There's a [[https://labs.w3.org/pubrules/|new pubrules checker]] in alpha status, if you feel brave and are willing to submit feedback to spec-prod@w3.org.)
  - **Request Publication -**
    - **For regular Working Drafts** on Bikeshed-formatted specs, you can use the ''bikeshed echidna'' command.
    - Otherwise, send a message (See Template Below) to Bert, ChrisL, and webreq, CCing w3c-css-wg, asking them to put your spec in the publication pipeline. Include a link to your draft and to the minutes with the resolution to publish. Put ''[Publish]'' in the subject line.
    - **For FPWD**, you also need a resolution on the shortname of the spec, and need the W3C domain leader (plh, in our case) to approve the FPWD publication and the choice of URL.
  - **Wait for Publication -** Wait for the spec to be published. For Echidna-published specs, this should take a few minutes. For other specs, W3C publishes on Tuesdays and Thursdays once webreq has approved the publication.
  - **Announce Your Spec -** Post an announcement of your new spec to [[mailto:www-style@w3.org|www-style]] (and cross-post to [[mailto:public-review-announce@w3.org|public-review-announce]] and any other relevant mailing lists]] and the [[https://www.w3.org/blog/CSS/wp-admin/|CSSWG Blog]] (See Templates Below) and link the blog post from [[http://twitter.com/csswg|@csswg]]. If you need help with this, ask fantasai. A good announcement includes:
     * A link to the spec
     * An explanation of what's new, what's cool, what's changed, maybe what to expect going forward, but most importantly what you would especially like feedback on.
     * Instructions for sending feedback
    - The CSSWG blog is your communication channel to people who aren't technical enough or devoted enough to follow www-style/GitHub. Take advantage of it, and engage your audience.
  - **Post-publication edits -** Add the new "Previous version" link to the editor's draft, and if you edited the editors draft to have Status: and Date: fields in them, restore Status to ED, remove Date, and possibly remove Deadline

Note: The above combines steps specific to the CSS WG and general W3C-wide [[http://services.w3.org/xslt?xmlfile=http://www.w3.org/2005/08/01-transitions.html&xslfile=http://www.w3.org/2005/08/transitions.xsl|publication rules.]] See the latter also for steps to publishing a Note, CR, PR, etc.

===== Steps for Manual Publication =====

To publish directly with the Webmaster, leave out the staff contact from the publication request, and inform webreq that you will be the contact person for the publication. Then send a reply only to webreq with a zipfile of the publication. (This way we're all on the thread, but only webreq gets the attachment.)

To prepare the zipfile, regenerate the spec for /TR publication and ensure that the files validate and pass pubrules (to the extent that you can check this). Also make sure that all files necessary for the publication <em>including default.css</em> are inside the same folder (and they continue to link up correctly). Zip that folder and send it to webreq as an attachment begging them to set it up for you.
