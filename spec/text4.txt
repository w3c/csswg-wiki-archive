====== Text Level 4 ======

===== Ideas =====

Ideas to consider for future CSS Text specs

  * Roman hanging punctuation
  * Glyph scaling min/max/desired (for improving justification)

===== text-spacing =====

  [ class-before class-after [ none | default [ [ [ min max ] | '/' alternate ] priority? ]? ] ]+

  @text-spacing-rule name {
    line-head opening 0%;
    closing line-end 50%/0%;
    ideograph alphabet 25% 12.5% 50% 2;
  }

  - The relationshipo of expansion opportunities defined here and other properties is an issue
  - JIS/JLREQ/InDesign style (trim and specify how much to add), or specify how much to add/remove?
  - Can 'none' have optional min/max/alternate/priority?
  - How to handle proportional punctuation is still an issue
