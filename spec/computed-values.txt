====== Computed Values Patterns ======

This page lists a number of design patterns that have been identified for computed values.

If you're a spec editor, you should check the "computed value:" definition of the properties in your spec with this document.

  - computed values should depend only on the specified or computed values of properties on the element or its parent
  - computed values must never depend on layout
  - shorthand properties do not have computed values. For them, simply specify: 
    * Computed value: see individual properties
  - url() resolvability cannot affect the computed value, since the concept of computed value shouldn't require accessing the network.
  - which format a url() resource is (e.g. whether the browser supports it) also cannot affect the computed value
  - URIs in computed values are absolute. E.g. 
    * Computed value: as specified, except with any relative URLs converted to absolute
  - properties that just accept keyword or IDREF values, should just specify: 
    * Computed value: as specified
  - (disputed) computed values should never depend on containing block hierarchy (though note that they already do in CSS21, eg 'height' for percentage values (http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2011Sep/0008.html)
