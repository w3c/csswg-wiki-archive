The Shapes portions of CSS Exclusions and Shapes are now their own module.

Currently, level 1 of CSS Shapes only includes shape-outside on floats with values from Basic Shapes and image URLs.

The intent is for the shape-inside property and defining shapes with SVG elements to be defined in a future level of CSS Shapes, as well as defining how Shapes contribute to exclusion areas in either a future level of CSS Shapes or CSS Exclusions. Given the postponement of shape-inside, it will need to default to 'auto' for backwards compatibility.
