===== CSS Exclusions and Shapes Page =====

This page is used to track:
  - new issues that are not yet flagged in the specification
  - resolutions about issues that were in the specification

This page started from the initial [[http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-exclusions//|CSS Exclusions and Shapes editor draft]].

===== Spec and Test Metadata =====

Each of the Regions tests will have metadata that points back one or more ids used in the Regions spec. These ids may be heading or dfn elements, or they may be ids added at the paragraph or sentence level to indicate a specific conformance requirement that must be tested. We should be able to scan the spec for ids (ignoring non-testable ids) and find at least one test for every testable id in the spec.

Whether an id is testable can be determined by scanning the spec and ignoring any id in elements with these class attributes: example, note, toc, no-toc or informative. The "informative" class attribute is new, and can be added around non-normative sections of the spec, or any id that's found not to correspond to a conformance requirement.
