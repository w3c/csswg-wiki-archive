==== Region Styling ====

With regions, element (or pseudo-element) boxes are often broken into multiple pieces that are laid out in different regions. 
For example, it is possible to move an element and its generated box with width:100% to a flow and 
layout the flow between two regions, one of width 500px and one of width 200px. In that situation,
the specified width for the element is 100% and its used value for the portion laid out in the first 
region is 500px and 200px for the second region.

So there is a notion of per-fragment used style.

In addition, regions have a notion of style that applies only to the fragments of an element that
falls into a particular region. A way to think about this is to consider that the selectors in the 
@region style rules apply to the pseudo-elements representing the fragment of the element that falls in
a particular region.

For example:

<code>
@region regionA {
    h2 {
        color: red;
    }
}
</code>

can be interpreted as specifying an additional property for the <code>h2::in-region(regionA)</code> pseudo-element.

If we follow that model, the used style for the content falling into a particular region could be retrieved as:

<code>
window.getComputedStyle(elem, '::in-region(regionA)');
</code>
