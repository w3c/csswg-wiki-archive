==== Region Styling ====

With regions, element (or pseudo-element) boxes are often broken into multiple pieces that are laid out in different regions. 
For example, it is possible to move an element and its generated box with width:100% to a flow and 
layout the flow between two regions, one of width 500px and one of width 200px. In that situation,
the specified width for the element is 100% and its used value for the portion laid out in the first 
region is 500px and 200px for the second region.

So there is a notion of per-fragment used style.

In addition, regions have a notion of style that applies only to the fragments of an element that
falls into a particular region. A way to think about this is to consider that the selectors in the 
@region style rules apply to the pseudo-elements representing the fragment of the element that falls in
a particular region.

For example:

<code>
@region regionA {
    h2 {
        color: red;
    }
}
</code>

can be interpreted as specifying an additional property for the <code>h2::in-region(regionA)</code> pseudo-element.

If we follow that model, the used style for the content falling into a particular region could be retrieved as:

<code>
window.getComputedStyle(elem, '::in-region(regionA)');
</code>

=== Open questions ===

  * Can we chain pseudo-elements? For example, can we do the following:

<code>
window.getComputedStyle(elem, "::before::in-region(regionA)");
</code>

According to the [[http://dev.w3.org/csswg/selectors3/#w3cselgrammar|Selectors Level 3]] specification: 
   
<file>
Note that pseudo-elements are restricted to one per selector and occur only in the last simple_selector_sequence.
</file>

which seems to prevent the combination of a '::before' pseudo-element selector with another '::in-region()' pseudo selector. 

  * Should we use the pseudo-element syntax for setting style?

This has been discussed before, for example in the following [[http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2012Jan/0626.html|thread]]. 
In light of the above, it seems to be a better syntax than the @region style rule:

<code>
h2::in-region(regionA) {
   color: red;
}
</code>
