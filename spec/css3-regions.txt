This section keeps track of the CSS WG resolutions regarding the CSS Regions specification. A checkmark indicates that the resolution has been integrated at least in the latest editor draft.

[[http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2011Jun/0329.html|Kyoto F2F June 2011, Saturday]]

  * ✔ RESOLVED: Switch content-order to take <integer>
  * <html><span style="color:gray">Discussed syntax for pushing to/pulling from named flows.</span></html>
  * <html><span style="color:gray">Briefly discussed integration of regions with multicol and grid layout.</span></html>

  * ✔ use ident for flow names in CSS Regions
  * <html><span color="gray">Disagreement on whether CSS Regions should use the 'content' property or have separate 'flow-from' property that overloads 'content: normal'.</span></html>
  * ✔ content selection should not be mentioned in the spec. It is a UI issue.
  * ✔ confirmed that the event propagation model should not be modified.
  * ✔ make the section on DOM events model informative.
  * ✔ CSS OM View:
    * ✔ confirmed the current proposal (NamedFlow + Element interface extension)
    * ✔ agreed to add event on changes to regionOverflow and flowRanges
===== Action Items =====

[[http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Tracker/actions/330|ACTION 330]]
  * Vincent: Regions spec. editors to specify a model for breaking flow content across areas that accounts for regions, columns and pages. Build on paged media and propose behavior for nested flows breaks. See the [[spec:css3-regions:breaks-use-cases|breaks use cases]] page.
✔ [[http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2011Jul/0241.html|Vincent's action email]]  
✔ [[http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-css-wg/2011JulSep/0107.html|Alex's proposal]]

  * Vincent: document the from-flow v.s. content issue and create proposal.
✔ See below.
====== Done ======

===== To Do ====

===== Issues to Resolve with the CSS WG =====

==== Issue 1 : content: from-flow(<flow-name>) v.s. from-flow: <flow-name>====
  ;URL : [[http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2011Jun/0413.html|WG Conference Call, [CSSWG] Minutes and Resolutions 2011-06-15]]
  ;Summary : content: from-flow(<flow-name>) v.s. from-flow: <flow-name>
  ;Proposal : content: from-flow(<flow-name>)

**cons**:
  * collapses two different concepts together.
**pros**:
  * clear interaction between 'content' and 'flow-from'

  ;Proposal A: from-flow: <flow-name>; 
  
**cons**:
           * Need to define the precedent between the content property and the flow-from property. 
           * Concerns about the cascade implications of having from-flow: none


**pros**:
           * Separate concepts (content for content belonging to the element, flow-from for getting a segment of content from the flow)



   ;Recommendation: use from-flow: <flow-name>;
   
   This requires no alteration to the definition of 'content', clearly separates the concept of flow and the concept of generated content.
==== Issue 2 : Auto-sizing of regions ====
  ;URL : http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2011Jun/0629.html
  ;Summary : Define intrinsic size of regions (currently zero, but there isn't a consensus that it's the best choice)

There are different options for behavior of regions of undefined size, with different pros and cons. 

See [[http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2011Jun/0682.html|Possible Options]]

  ;Proposal : Option c in the above proposal.
  
==== Issue 3 : Regions Break ====
  ;URL : http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2011Jul/0241.html
  ;Summary : Should we add a new type of break for content in regions or should we specify which breaks should be honored when flowing content in regions?
  ;Discussion : see URL and response from Alex. The general idea is that we should be able to define a region 'type' for content that is getting laid out and honor breaks for that container 'type'. So if a region has 'flow-container-type' set to column, then it will honor column breaks in the content it lays out.
  ;Proposal: [[http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-css-wg/2011JulSep/0107.html|See Alex's proposal]] 
  
  
==== Issue 4 : Copying Flow Content ====

  ;URL : http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2011May/0521.html
  ;Summary : Should we allow copying content in a flow instead of moving it in the flow?
  ;Discussion : this brings complexity and the benefits do not seem to offset that drawback (more complex DOM access, CSS OM View and computed style issues).
  ;Proposal : in the first version of CSS Regions, only allows moving content to a flow, not copying.
