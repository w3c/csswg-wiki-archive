  * ✔ use ident for flow names in CSS Regions
  * <html><span color="gray">Disagreement on whether CSS Regions should use the 'content' property or have separate 'flow-from' property that overloads 'content: normal'.</span></html>
  * ✔ content selection should not be mentioned in the spec. It is a UI issue.
  * ✔ confirmed that the event propagation model should not be modified.
  * ✔ make the section on DOM events model informative.
  * ✔ CSS OM View:
    * ✔ confirmed the current proposal (NamedFlow + Element interface extension)

===== Action Items ====

[[http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Tracker/actions/330|ACTION 330]]
  * Vincent: Regions spec. editors to specify a model for breaking flow content across areas that accounts for regions, columns and pages. Build on paged media and propose behavior for nested flows breaks. See the [[spec:css3-regions:breaks-use-cases|breaks use cases]] page

  * Vincent: document the from-flow v.s. content issue and create proposal.

===== Issues to Resolve with the CSS WG =====

==== Issue 1 : content: from-flow(<flow-name>) v.s. from-flow: <flow-name>====
  ;URL : [[http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2011Jun/0413.html|WG Conference Call, [CSSWG] Minutes and Resolutions 2011-06-15]]
  ;Summary : content: from-flow(<flow-name>) v.s. from-flow: <flow-name>
  ;Proposal : content: from-flow(<flow-name>)

**cons**:
  * collapses two different concepts together.
**pros**:
  * clear interaction between 'content' and 'flow-from'

  ;Proposal A: from-flow: <flow-name>; 
  
**cons**:
           * Need to define the precedent between the content property and the flow-from property. 
           * Concerns about the cascade implications of having from-flow: none


**pros**:
           * Separate concepts (content for content belonging to the element, flow-from for getting a segment of content from the flow)



   ;Recommendation: use from-flow: <flow-name>;
   
   This requires no alteration to the definition of 'content', clearly separates the concept of flow and the concept of generated content.
==== Issue 2 ====
  ;URL : http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2011Jun/0629.html
  ;Summary : Define intrinsic size of regions (currently zero, but there isn't a consensus that it's the best choice)

There are different options for behavior of regions of undefined size, with different pros and cons. Options include:
  * no intrinsic size (follow box model or normal flow; that usually has default height of zero)
  * same intrinsic size as replaced elements (300x150)
  * fall back to replaced elemetn intrinsic size (300x150) but only if left undefined by normal block box model
