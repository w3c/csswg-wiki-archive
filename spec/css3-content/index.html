====== CSS3 Generated Content Outline ======

The current module has way too much stuff in it. A pared down version should be created that includes:

  * stuff from CSS2.1
  * ::marker and ::line-marker
  * 'content' property with
      * 'contents' keyword
      * any necessary "I want nothing" keywords
      * comma-separated fallbacks
      * require-font()
