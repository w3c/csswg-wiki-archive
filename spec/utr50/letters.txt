====== Letters, Numbers, and Spaces Orientation By Codepoint ======

This page is intended to help analyze Unicode wrt text orientation. It is not comprehensive at all yet.

Category Codes:

^Code^UTR50^MSFT^Meaning^
^U|U|S|Upright; translates between horizontal and vertical|
^R|S|R|Sideways; rotates between horizontal and vertical|
^T<sub>U</sub>|T|ST|Typeset upright with alternate glyph. Best fallback is just upright.|
^T<sub>R</sub>|SB|RT|Typeset upright with alternate glyph. Best fallback is just sideways.|

Two modes are presented: Stacking (''text-orientation: upright'') and Default (TBD).

===== Letters (L*) and Script-Specific Numbers (N*) =====

Letters and script-specific (non-Common) numbers are classified by using their script property (including [[http://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/ScriptExtensions.txt|Script Extensions property]]).
