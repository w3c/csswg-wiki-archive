====== Letters and Numbers Orientation By Codepoint ======

This page is intended to help analyze Unicode wrt text orientation. It is not comprehensive at all yet.

Category Codes:

^Code^UTR50^MSFT^Meaning^
^U|U|S|Upright; translates between horizontal and vertical|
^R|S|R|Sideways; rotates between horizontal and vertical|
^T<sub>U</sub>|T|ST|Typeset upright with alternate glyph. Best fallback is just upright.|
^T<sub>R</sub>|SB|RT|Typeset upright with alternate glyph. Best fallback is just sideways.|

Two modes are presented: Stacking (''text-orientation: upright'') and Default (TBD).

===== Letters (L*) and Script-Specific Numbers (N*) =====

Letters and script-specific (non-Common) numbers are classified by using their script property (including [[http://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/ScriptExtensions.txt|Script Extensions property]]). [[numbers|Common numbers]] are listed separately.

|Brai|Braille|U|U|:?: Checking with DAISY but haven't got back yet. Most resources say Braille cannot flow vertical. [[http://www.design-thinking.jp/2011/04/blog-post.html|This page]] indicates [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanada_Yukimura|Yukimura Sanada]] developed vertical Braille as R in 16th century, but this is probably different from the today's Braille. [[http://www6.ocn.ne.jp/~takut/tenjiehon.html|This book]] has vertical modern Braille, but can't identify if it's U or R from the picture.|
|Egyp|Egyptian Hieroglyphs|U|U| |
|Hira|Hiragana|U|U| |
|Kana|Katakana|U|U|Unclear whether halfwidth katakana should be upright or sideways; voice marks are broken if set upright.|

|Mero|Meroitic Hieroglyphs|U|U| |
|Mong|Mongolian|V|V|Mongolian in Unicode code chart shows vertical glyphs and most font today has glyphs in 90 degree CCW rotated, so they are U from Unicode point of view, but R from UA point of view. Call it V.|

|Orkh|Old Turkic|R|R| |
|Phag|Phags Pa|V|V|Same as Mongolian.|
|Yiii|Yi|U|U|Old documents show Yi rotated sideways (as vertical script), but one example of modern Yi (typeset horizontally) uses upright-stacked captions|
|Arab|Arabic|U|R|:?: Still debating how to handle cursive RTL in stacked mode|
