====== Grid Layout Level 2 Ideas ======

===== Collapsing Tracks =====

We want the ability to collapse grid tracks (similar to collapsing flex items or table rows/columns), but we're not sure exactly how to do it.  One attempt:

>Specifying ''visibility: collapse'' on a <a>grid item</a> causes it to become a <dfn export title="collapsed grid item|collapsed">collapsed grid item</dfn>. This has the same effect as ''visibility: hidden'', except that if all the <a>grid items</a> spanning a track are <a>collapsed</a>, the track's [intrinsic]? size becomes zero.
