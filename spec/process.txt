====== Spec Advancement Process ======
By default the CSSWG follows the W3C Process: http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/

Here are some thoughts on improvements.

===== test and implementation driven agile spec advancement =====
One of the most common criticisms of the CSSWG is that specs/features take too long. In particular many features have been implemented with vendor prefixes, inconveniencing authors and implementers alike  for *years* and resulting in a need to maintain support for prefixed properties ([[https://wiki.mozilla.org/Platform/Layout/CSS_Compatibility#CSS_vendor-prefix_compatibility|or worse]]).

This proposal provides improvements that encourage rapid draft advancement based on implementations and tests. - Tantek 2012-038

==== principles ====
Drafts should:
  * be published early and often to show interest/activity
  * transparently note objections/issues
  * advance as rapidly as implementations and tests show interest/interop
  * drop/postpone features lacking implementation(s) to not hold up interoperable features

==== process for advancement ====
Here are proposed improvements to accelerate the advancement of specs. These improvements can be adopted by the group as a whole, but they're also designed for individual editors to follow as a way to more rapidly advance their drafts.
  * <html><span style="font-size:2em;font-weight:bold;vertical-align:-.1em;line-height:0.5em">✍</span></html>**->ED.** Any member of the CSSWG may check-in an editor's draft to present ideas/content for consideration. Contents of the draft must be within the WG charter. Any objections raised by CSSWG members must be noted in the ED.
  * **ED->WD.** When any feature is implemented (as shown by publicly posted test case document), a public working draft is published.
  * **WD->LC.** When any feature is interoperably implemented by more than one implementation, the WD is automatically published as a LC with a 6 week review period. Any unimplemented feature is marked *at-risk*.
    * This assessment is made at the CSSWG telcon/f2f.
    * Since the CSSWG telcon is on Wednesday and the draft publication occurs the next Tuesday, if anyone posts a public test case document that disproves the interoperability before that Monday, the LC is merely published as another WD.
    * When anyone posts public test case document(s) that disproves interoperability of all previously shown interoperable features, the LC review period clock is stopped.
      * When implementations are updated to once again demonstrate interoperability of at least one feature, the 6 week LC review period is restarted as of that date.
    * **LC->LC** updates may be published per editor discretion, e.g. when more features are implemented, which may result in fewer being *at-risk*. This restarts a new 6 week LC review period.
  * **LC->CR.** At the end of the LC review period, the LC is automatically published as a CR with a 6 month implementation period. Any unimplemented features are dropped and postponed to the next version. Any features with only one implementation, or not interoperably implemented are marked *at-risk*.
    * **CR->CR** updates may be published per editor discretion, e.g. when more features are interoperably implemented, which may result in fewer being marked *at-risk*. The 6 month implementation period is *not* restarted.
  * **CR->PR.** At the end of the CR implementation period, the CR is automatically published as a PR. Any features that are not interoperably implemented are dropped and postponed to the next version.
  * **PR->REC.** Follow standard W3C process. Suggestions welcome.
