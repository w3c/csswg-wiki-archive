====== CSS Writing Modes Level 3 ======

The biggest issue is the default text-orientation of common symbols and punctuation, so here's a table to start figuring it all out. :)

Orientation Codes:

  ; U : always upright
  ; S : always sideways
  ; G : upright with alt glyph, else fallback to sideways
  ; ? : unknown
  ; [1] : Special Behavior #1 (see notes below table)

===== Data Table =====

Name	Codepoint	Char	CSSWG	Unicode	AH	Notes

Middle Dot	U+00B7	⋅	*	?	?	Sideways in Japanese, Upright in Chinese

=== Notes ===

[1] **U** if ''lang=zh'', else **S**
