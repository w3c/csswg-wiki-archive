====== CSS Writing Modes Level 3 ======

The biggest issue is the default text-orientation of common symbols and punctuation, so here's a table to start figuring it all out. :)

Orientation Codes:

  ; U : always upright
  ; S : always sideways
  ; G : upright with alt glyph, else fallback to sideways
  ; ? : unknown
  ; [1] : Special Behavior #1 (see notes below table)

===== Data Table =====

<note>
If a column has different behavior for Japanese and Chinese, then write both with a slash: Ja/Zh.
