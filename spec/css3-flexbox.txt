==== Issue 1 ====
  ;URL : http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2011Jun/thread.html#msg37
  ;Summary : Multiline flexbox is missing from current draft
  
Multiline flexbox needs at least 4 bits to choose from directional options (can be more to tie to writing mode, but not less):
  - horizontal or vertical primary direction
  - horizontal or vertical transverse direction
  - single line or multiple lines
  - horizontal or vertical line progression

Current draft combines orientation and direction in one property [[http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-flexbox/#flex-direction0]], it works well for common cases but does not easily extent to multiline situation.

Some options for adding mutiline are listed here: [[http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2011Jun/0116.html]]

  ;Proposal : http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2011Jun/0134.html -- best proposal so far (from Fantasai)
<code>
  flex-orientation: rows | columns | horizontal | vertical
  flex-wrap: no-wrap | wrap | balance*
  flex-direction: [ forward | backward ] || reverse-stack
</code>
(this doesn't inlclude "line-progression")

See Issue 1. Resolutoin of Issue 1 depends on making it possible to specify more directoins.

==== Issue 3 ====
  ;URL : //todo//
  ;Summary : flexbox has two ways to align in transverse directions
  
2009 spec had box-align propery with values similar to vertical-align in table cells (start/end/center/stretch/baseline). Current spec adds alignment via auto margins and padding, however 'flex-align' property remains, just for baseline alignment. Having two ways to align, both incomplete, is inconsistent and confusing. 

It may be OK, if margin-based alignment is more powerful, having two ways to align may be justified. At this point however, margin-based alignment (using "margin:auto") doesn't provide any new ways of alignment that were not possible with flex-slign property. 

Historically, it was proposed that margins can have flex values, which 

Alignment via margins doesn't really add new ways of alignment that were not possible before the change

==== Issue 4 ====
  ;URL : http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2011May/0271.html
  ;Summary : consider 'true-center' as an align option for flexbox
  
'true-center' has been proposed many times and has dedicated supporeters. Now that flexbox is adding anumber of special layout rules and unique behavior, including new kinds of alignment, why not include true-center? There is no need to describe why it can be very useful.
