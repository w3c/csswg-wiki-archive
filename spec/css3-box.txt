====== CSS Box Module Level 3 ======

The goals of the CSS3 Box spec are to rewrite the CSS2.1 box model such that it is:

  * more understandable (better organization and clearer prose)
  * more precise (defines vague or missing concepts from CSS2.1, defines undefined concepts from CSS2.1)
  * generalized to handle vertical text (See CSS Writing Modes module)

This page is to track specifically the remaining work on the CSS Box module. Please post issues to [[http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/|www-style]] first for discussion, then add a summary and a link to the discussion on this page.

====== General Problems to Solve ======
