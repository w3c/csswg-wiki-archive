====== CSS Box Module Level 3 ======

The goals of the CSS3 Box spec are to rewrite the CSS2.1 box model such that it is:

  * more understandable (better organization and clearer prose)
  * more precise (defines vague or missing concepts from CSS2.1, defines undefined concepts from CSS2.1)
  * generalized to handle vertical text (See CSS Writing Modes module)

====== General Problems to Solve ======

This section is for describing general problems that the CSS Box module must solve, e.g. concepts that need defining or refining, or spec areas that should be rewritten to improve clarity.

====== Spec Issues ======

This section is for listing errors in the spec and mismatches against CSS2.1.
