  ;Proposal : http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2007Jun/0096.html
  ;Resolution : Proposal accepted
  ;Status : Needs editor approval + edits

==== Issue 3 ====

  ;URL : http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2007Jun/0073.html
  ;Summary : Middle image doesn't scale to match border images
  ;Status : Needs discussion


==== Issue 4 ====

  ;URL : http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2007Jun/0208.html
  ;Summary : Shorthand for ''border-radius'' unnecessarily restrictive.
  ;Resolution : the ''border-radius'' shorthand shall take up to four values that each set both radii for the corresponding corner as in Mozilla's implementation. The first value applies to the top-left corner, and rest are assigned clockwise. Missing values are filled in by repeating the pattern. There is no conclusion on adopting an extended syntax that allows setting elliptical curves.
  ;Status : Needs edits.
