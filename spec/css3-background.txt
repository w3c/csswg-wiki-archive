...

===== Current Issues =====

The following are known problems in the [[http://www.w3.org/TR/2005/WD-css3-background-20050216/|16 February 2005 CSS Backgrounds and Borders Level 3 Working Draft]].

==== Issue 1 ====

  ;URL : http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2006Jul/0017.html
  ;Summary : Specify what happens when border-radius is more than 50% of the box's width/height.
  ;Status : Needs proposal



==== Issue 2 ====

  ;URL : http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2006Jul/0017.html
  ;Summary : Need border-image clarifications
  ;Proposal : http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2007Jun/0096.html
  ;Resolution : Proposal accepted
  ;Status : Needs editor approval + edits

==== Issue 3 ====

  ;URL : http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2007Jun/0073.html
  ;Summary : Middle image doesn't scale to match border images
  ;Status : Needs discussion



==== Issue 4 ====

  ;URL : http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2007Jun/0208.html
  ;Summary : Shorthand for ''border-radius'' unnecessarily restrictive.
  ;Resolution : the ''border-radius'' shorthand shall take up to four values that each set both radii for the corresponding corner as in Mozilla's implementation. The first value applies to the top-left corner, and rest are assigned clockwise. Missing values are filled in by repeating the pattern. There is no conclusion on adopting an extended syntax that allows setting elliptical curves.
  ;Status : Needs edits.

==== Issue 5 ====

  ;URL : http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2007Jun/0208.html
  ;Summary : No defined behavior for overlapping radii.
  ;Proposal : Reduce both radii of affected corners in proportion, thereby preserving the shape of the curves. Still need proposal on how various corners interact.
  ;Resolution : Result should not create pointy intersections. Details unresolved.
  ;Status : Needs precise mathematical proposal.
