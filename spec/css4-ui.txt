====== css4-ui features list ======

The [[http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-ui/|CSS Basic User Interface Module Level 3]] (CSS3-UI, latest Editor's draft) defines user interface related selectors, properties and values.

CSS3-UI is deliberately scoped to what's been interoperably implemented, so it's a firm stake in the ground that implementers and authors can depend on.

CSS4-UI is for new features above and beyond CSS3-UI.

In somewhat order of priority:

===== extensions to css3-ui features =====

==== implementation extensions ====
Implementations may have found it useful to extend existing CSS3-UI features, but perhaps they are only experimental extensions or single implementations.

As these are most likely to be practical and minimal (and supported by a second implementation), these are the first features we'll consider.

  * new 'cursor' values:
    * 'grab' - supported by Mozilla as [[https://developer.mozilla.org/en/CSS/-moz-grab|-moz-grab]]
    * 'grabbing' - supported by Mozilla as [[https://developer.mozilla.org/En/CSS/-moz-grabbing|-moz-grabbing]]
    * see [[https://developer.mozilla.org/en/CSS/cursor#Mozilla_extensions|CSS cursor Mozilla extensions]] for more
    * consider more from: http://www.gtalbot.org/DHTMLSection/Cursors.html#Proprietary

==== real world author extension needs ====
Second, users and authors may have found that they wanted a CSS3-UI feature to work a certain way in their sites, and these real world needs are a second consideration.

  * ...

==== theoretical extension requests ====
Third, there are hypothetical requests for extensions to CSS3-UI features. As these are not real world proven (only theoretical) demands, they are purely tertiary. We may consider them optimistically and include them in working drafts to solicit feedback and additional interest.

  * ...

===== new css4-ui features =====
Brand new features fo CSS4-UI. We'll follow the same prioritization as above.

  * ...

===== dropped css3 features =====
Features that were dropped from CSS3-UI (e.g. the 2004 CR) are eligible to be considered for CSS4-UI, but they will need a strong justification as having been ignored by implementations for 6+ years means there was likely something wrong with them and they need major revising. In addition, features dropped from other CSS3 specs or trimmed when bringing over to CSS3-UI are also considered here.

==== text-overflow string ====
text-overflow: <string>. consider incorporating dropped <string> value. 

Originally text-overflow: <string> was [[http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/CR-css3-text-20030514/#text-overflow-ellipsis|defined in CSS3 Text CR 2003-05-14]] - but no one implemented it. Thus any request for including this MUST include some justification as to why/how implementations would consider it differently than they did (and reject) for CSS3 Text CR 2003.

Theoretical use-cases:
  * multilingual
  * author might wish to use "(...)" for instance in citations
  * vertical ellipsis in maths
  * a line that has nothing but images on it. Having two markers also motivates having a &lt;string&gt; value to be able to specify different symbols on each side.

Possible spec markup:

<code>
<td>clip | ellipsis | 
   <a class="noxref" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/syndata.html#value-def-string">
     <span class="value-inst-string">&lt;string&gt;</span></a>
</td>
...
      <dt><dfn title="text-overflow:&lt;string&gt;">
           <var>&lt;string&gt;</var></dfn></dt>
        <dd>Render the given string to represent clipped text.</dd>
</code>

==== text-overflow string plus ====
The string value for text-overflow should have the same syntax as the content rule.

Theoretical use-cases:
  * author might want to use an image
  * author might want to use css counters
  * author might want to use an attribute contents for the ellipsis

==== text-overflow block hint ====
text-overflow: second <string> as an overflow visual hint after the element box. The visual hint after the element box only appears if there is content which is clipped because of the block-progression dimension of the block, not because the last line cannot fit. If the visual hint after the element box is enabled and would appear at the same location as the visual hint at the end of the element box, only the visual hint after the element box is rendered. 

Originally text-overflow: second <string> was [[http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/CR-css3-text-20030514/#text-overflow-ellipsis|defined in CSS3 Text CR 2003-05-14]] - but no one implemented it. Thus any request for including this MUST include some justification as to why/how implementations would consider it differently than they did (and reject) for CSS3 Text CR 2003.

Use-cases:
  * what iTunes App Store does for its app descriptions (more details needed).

===== Current Issues =====

There is no editor's draft of CSS3 UI yet - so there's nothing to have issues against!

The editor's draft will eventually be here:
