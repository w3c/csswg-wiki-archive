====== css4-ui features list ======

The [[http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-ui/|CSS Basic User Interface Module Level 3]] (CSS3-UI, latest Editor's draft) defines user interface related selectors, properties and values.

CSS3-UI is deliberately scoped to what's been interoperably implemented, so it's a firm stake in the ground that implementers and authors can depend on.

CSS4-UI is for new features above and beyond CSS3-UI.

In somewhat order of priority:

===== extensions to css3-ui features =====

==== implementation extensions ====
Implementations may have found it useful to extend existing CSS3-UI features, but perhaps they are only experimental extensions or single implementations.

As these are most likely to be practical and minimal (and supported by a second implementation), these are the first features we'll consider.

  * ...

==== real world author extension needs ====
Second, users and authors may have found that they wanted a CSS3-UI feature to work a certain way in their sites, and these real world needs are a second consideration.

  * ...

==== theoretical extension requests ====
Third, there are hypothetical requests for extensions to CSS3-UI features. As these are not real world proven (only theoretical) demands, they are purely tertiary. We may consider them optimistically and include them in working drafts to solicit feedback and additional interest.

  * ...

===== new css4-ui features =====
Brand new features fo CSS4-UI. We'll follow the same prioritization as above.

  * ...

===== dropped css3 features =====
Features that were dropped from CSS3-UI (e.g. the 2004 CR) are eligible to be considered for CSS4-UI, but they will need a strong justification as having been ignored by implementations for 6+ years means there was likely something wrong with them and they need major revising. In addition, features dropped from other CSS3 specs or trimmed when bringing over to CSS3-UI are also considered here.

==== text-overflow string ====
text-overflow: <string>. consider incorporating dropped <string> value. 

Originally text-overflow: <string> was [[http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/CR-css3-text-20030514/#text-overflow-ellipsis|defined in CSS3 Text CR 2003-05-14]] - but no one implemented it. Thus any request for including this MUST include some justification as to why/how implementations would consider it differently than they did (and reject) for CSS3 Text CR 2003.

Possible spec markup:

<code>
<td>clip | ellipsis | 
   <a class="noxref" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/syndata.html#value-def-string">
     <span class="value-inst-string">&lt;string&gt;</span></a>
</td>
...
      <dt><dfn title="text-overflow:&lt;string&gt;">
           <var>&lt;string&gt;</var></dfn></dt>
        <dd>Render the given string to represent clipped text.</dd>
</code>

There is no editor's draft of CSS3 UI yet - so there's nothing to have issues against!
