==== Issue 2011-07-03-3 ====
  ; Summary : Clarify 3.2 'treated'
  ; Raised by : Anton Prowse
  ; URL : http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2011Jul/0025.html 
  ; URL : http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2011Jul/0094.html
  ; Reporter's response to resolution : 
  ; Proposed Resolution : Need to clarify 3.2 that treated doesn't affect the computed value. Change "except that 'auto' is treated" to "except that a computed value of 'auto' is treated" to make it clear that it doesn't change the computed value. Or maybe "behaves as if its z-index were zero".
  ; Status : open, rough edits proposed.
