====== CSS Cascading and Inheritance ======

This spec is about how property values are assigned to elements.

Notes on things to maybe cover:

  * cascading and inheritance, of course :)
  * value computation stages
  * 'initial', 'inherit', and any other defaulting keywords
  * shorthands and the 'all' shorthand
  * propdef tables intro (missing so far in CSS3)
