====== Summary ======

Documents with text-align: justify, without the content language nor text-justify set are not interoperable today, so any specs involves some costs. We need to make a choice which costs to take and which not to.

====== Options ======

  a. Expand ideograph (i.e., between ideograph and any), but not Hangul
  b. Not expand ideograph nor Hangul
  c. A compromised algorithm, spacing varies by the content of line

  x. Add text-justify: inter-ideograph back

====== Expects ======

^Documents^a^b^c^
|text-justify: inter-ideograph (for IE5+)|A|D for B/W, - (D) for T/G<sup>*1</sup>|B<sup>*1</sup>|
|CJ|A|D for B/W, - (D) for T/G|B|
|Hangul only, 70-80% of K|- (A)|- (A)|B|
|Hangul+Han, 20-30% of K|C|A|B|
|Han only, 1-10% of K|A|D for B/W, - (D) for T/G|B|

  * B is worse than A, C is worse and B, D is worse than C, and so forth
  * "- (x)" means no changes from past versions, but evaluates to “x"
  * for B=Blink, G=Gecko, T=Trident, W=WebKit
  * <sup>*1</sup> Option x can make this to “A"

Following criteria are out of scope of this discussion:
  * text-align is not justify. The choice does not make any differences in this case.
  * has lang attribute. The spec says UA **may** tailor by the content language.
  * text-jusitfy: inter-word. The spec defines behavior in this case.
