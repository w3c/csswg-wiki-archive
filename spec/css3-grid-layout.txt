===== Action Items =====

===== Issues =====
==== Issue 1:  ===
Grid-layer vs. z-index property for Grid

Grid-layer is currently used to control the stacking of grid items in a grid element; one example of this would be using Grid to build a range control where the "thumb" of the control is displayed on top of the underlying track. However, grid-layer is in many ways similar to the existing z-index property. Is a separate property needed, or can z-index replace the grid-layer property?

==== Issue 2:  ===
Updating the fractional algorithm to deal with shrink-to-fit grid elements

The current spec does not define how fractionally-sized grid items are sized when the grid element is shrink-to-fit. This needs to be defined in the spec.

One use case that should be considered is where fractionally-sized-tracks intersect with spanning elements, as in the image below.
