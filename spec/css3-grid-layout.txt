==== Issue 1:  ====
Grid-layer vs. z-index property for Grid

= Summary: =

Grid-layer is currently used to control the stacking of grid items in a grid element; one example of this would be using Grid to build a range control where the "thumb" of the control is displayed on top of the underlying track. However, grid-layer is in many ways similar to the existing z-index property. Is a separate property needed, or can z-index replace the grid-layer property?

= Proposal: =

Z-index should be used to replace the grid-layer property. Specifically, in cases where Grid Items overlap, z-index provides control over the drawing order of Grid Items. Both Grid elements and Grid Items generate a stacking context as described for floats (step 5, section 14) in the [[http://www.w3.org/TR/2007/WD-css3-box-20070809/#stacking|CSS3 Box Model]]. Note that this would imply that z-index applies to statically positioned Grid Items. 

Note also that this change has been [[http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2011May/0344.html|previously discussed]] on the www-styling mailing list.
