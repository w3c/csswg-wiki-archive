Grid-layer vs. z-index property for Grid

Grid-layer is currently used to control the stacking of grid items in a grid element; one example of this would be using Grid to build a range control where the "thumb" of the control is displayed on top of the underlying track. However, grid-layer is in many ways similar to the existing z-index property. Is a separate property needed, or can z-index replace the grid-layer property?
