===== WG Resolution Whiteboard =====

==== CSS2.1 Dependency ====

^Summary^Values and Units depends on CSS2.1 NUMBER token which is wrong|
^DoC|http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-values/issues-lc-2012#issue-20|
^Action|Resolve on 2.1 issue and either update CSS2.1 errata or update Values and Units|

==== calc() ====

See [[http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2012Apr/0531.html|Tab's summary email]]

^Summary^calc() should be able to return an <integer>|
^DoC|http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-values/issues-lc-2012#issue-10|
^Action|WG needs to decide whether this is ok. We propose yes.|
^Summary^calc() should accept <length>/<number> instead of DIMENSION/NUMBER|
^DoC|http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-values/issues-lc-2012#issue-11|
^Note|Divisors still need to be restricted to DIMENSION/NUMBER to prevent divide-by-zero.|
^Note|At this point in time, the only effective change is allowing attr() inside calc().|
^Note|This change can also be deferred to a later level; rejecting now doesn't mean we can't fix later.|
^Action|WG needs to decide whether to accept or reject.|

==== cycle() ====

^Summary^Multiple design-level issues with cycle()|
^DoC|http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-values/issues-lc-2012#issue-12 issues 12 through 16|
^Note|A number of design-level problems were found in cycle(), some of which prevent cycle() from solving some of its main use-cases.|
^Action|WG needs to decide whether to defer, accept the limitations, or work on issues. We propose to defer.|

==== URLs ====

^Summary^What spec should we refer to to define URL validity/parsing?|
^DoC|http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-values/issues-lc-2012#issue-17|
^Action|WG needs to advise on whether to reference abarth's spec, what's currently referenced, or something else.|
^Summary^Define an always-invalid url for the attr(foo url) default, like "about:invalid" or something|
^DoC|http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-values/issues-lc-2012#issue-18|
^Action|WG needs to decide whether to define this, and if so, what it is.|

==== attr() ====

^Summary^ Combinatorial validity checks when attr() used as component value with fallback of a different type.|
^DoC|http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-values/issues-lc-2012#issue-21|
^Note|Restricted attr() so that declared type and fallback type must match when it's used as a component value. See [[http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-values/#attr-notation|edits]] ("The attr() expression is only valid if") |
^Action|WG needs to approve this, or decide on something else|

==== Numeric Limits Revisited ====

^Summary^ Change component multiplier minimum from 30 to 20|
^DoC|http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-values/issues-lc-2012#issue-22|
^Action|Needs WG resolution to accept.|
^Summary^ Define minimum precision as 3 decimal points|
^DoC|http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-values/issues-lc-2012#issue-25|
^Action|Needs WG resolution to accept.|

==== Value Syntax Notation ====

^Summary^ Add order-sensitive component combinator|
^DoC|http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-values/issues-lc-2012#issue-27|
^Action|Decide whether to accept, reject, or defer. This is editorial.|
