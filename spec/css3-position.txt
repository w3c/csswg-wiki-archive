===== Action Items =====

===== Issues =====
==== Issue 1:  ====

Changing the positioning edge. Or changing the containing block.

There are issues with circular references. Need a way to handle this. 

Original proposal: http://www.xanthir.com/blog/b48H0

==== Issue 2: ====

Vertical centering using position.

Proposal from Tantek and Ian: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-css-wg/2002JulSep/0296.html 

==== Issue 3: ====

Need to add in logic to all the positioning logic to account for vertical layouts.

==== Issue 4: ====

Similar position solution to Fixed but relative to an element and where it is in relation to the page. If the containing block scrolls the element stays fixed. If the containing block scolls off the page the element goes with the containing block.

==== Issue 5: ====

z-index needs to acocunt for CSS3-floats
