====== Issue Tracking ======
Issues are tracked in the CSS Working Group as follows:

  * Editor's drafts have a link in their header to where issues are tracked for the draft (e.g. see "Issues List:" in header of [[http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-ui/|CSS3-UI editor's draft]]).
    * If all issues are tracked in the draft itself, this may just be a note saying as such.
  * Each CSS spec tracks issue in one of the four following ways per the preference of the spec's editor:
    - This wiki, e.g. see the individual spec pages linked from the [[../spec|specs]] page.
    - The W3C Issue Tracker
    - Bugzilla
    - Inline in the spec itself

If you're editing a spec, please use one of the four mechanisms above.

If you have a better mechanism you'd like to use, please first propose it to the working group.
