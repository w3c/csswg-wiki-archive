====== Ideas and Resolutions ======

A record of ideas and issues we have discussed for CSS3
and of resolutions we have adopted about the future of CSS,
particularly those that are not otherwise recorded in our
specifications (yet).




===== Resolutions =====

This list only includes ideas that have been vetted and approved by the CSS Working Group. They're here because we currently don't have a context (actively-edited specification) to put them in.

===== Ideas and Issues =====

This list includes ideas that are somewhere on the CSS Working Group's radar, but that haven't been formally discussed or accepted. These pages are publicly editable. Please include real-world use cases and links to prior discussion (e.g. on blogs or [[http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style|www-style]]).
